Title: Hopoo Games Development Thoughts #2
<p><br/>Hey! </p><p>With our first week of Early Access in the bag we thought we would share some more of our thoughts we have gathered over the week. We also want to thank everyone again for all of the support, emails, tweets, and feedback in such a short amount of time. Thank you all. </p><p>Similar to our first Developer Thoughts we wanted to break things down into Major and Minor Points, along with some things we have been working on.</p><h2>===Major Points===</h2><p>• We want to get our content roadmap available to users as soon as possible - we will be working on that this week.<br/>• Noting a LOT of people are dying very suddenly to blazing affixes and not enjoying it, and it will be tuned down. We do have concerns that the fire affix is artifically gating the difficulty and the game will be much easier once it&rsquo;s been normalized, but we will have to address that as it comes.<br/>• Noting people want a legitimate way to actively pursue lunar coins<br/>• Fighting Worm isn&rsquo;t fun, even though it is one of our higher effort bosses.<br/>• People have gotten far enough into the game that things just&hellip; stop spawning. For context, the game skips spawns that it deems is too easy for the number of &ldquo;spawn credits&rdquo; it has. If you&rsquo;ve gotten to that point congrats, the game thinks Overloading Worms are a bit too easy for you. This will naturally be fixed once higher tier monsters and affixes are added to the game. For now&hellip; it means that you terrified the whole planet.<br/>• Some players falling through the floor on level startup <br/>• Noting a large amount of players whose primary language isn&rsquo;t English who we want to support with localized text</p><h2>===Minor Points===</h2><p>• No one seems to notice Ice affix explosion on death<br/>• Some users are still getting really low performance, while some are not.<br/>• Prismatic Trials leaderboard change seems to be positive!<br/>• Noting a lot of concerns that characters will continually get nerfed in a PvE game<br/>• Engineer&rsquo;s weird dependency on Bustling Fungus to be viable has always been a concern for once we add more items - he will have a smaller percentage fungii in the pool. How will we make sure every item patch doesn&rsquo;t make Engi worse?<br/>• Noting the Mercenary sometimes launching Greater Wisps into space<br/>• MUL-T seems to have issues going up specific slopes with his lower speed<br/>• Noting players want the number of Stages Complete displayed on the HUD<br/>• Noting some Equipment are activating multiple times repeatedly over the network </p><h2>===Stuff we are working on===</h2><p>• Content/Early Access roadmap<br/>• Improving the way we save data to further prevent save file corruption or the game not saving at all<br/>• Players falling through the floor on entering a new stage<br/>• Wake of Vultures taking half your health<br/>• Improve MUL-T equipment swapping logic <br/>• Changing burning calculation<br/>• Improve the other elites (Ice, Lightning) to be threatening as well<br/>• Improve Worm fight to be fun<br/>• Changing the way some languages handle specific characters and fonts to make sure they are consistent<br/>• Some inconsistent proc coefficients for certain survivor abilities (Artificer is very very low for no reason)<br/>• Lots of bug fixes and quality of life improvements <br/>• Adding in some Community Suggestions we have gathered from tweets, emails, and the official Discord</p><p>Please let us know if we missed anything - there is lots more going on behind the scenes but we wanted to make sure we get some of this information shared with the community. Again, thank you all so much for the amazing first week. We are so excited for the future of RoR 2 and what&rsquo;s to come!   </p><p><i>-Hopoo Games Team</i></p>

Title: Hopoo Games Development Thoughts #1
<p>HOLYMOLY<br/>O<br/>L<br/>Y<br/>M<br/>O<br/>L<br/>Y</p><p>Uh, ok. First, I just wanted to say from the whole team how absolutely floored we are with the reception so far. I was personally hoping for something to match at least half of the original game: apparently we&rsquo;re doing a LOT better. It&rsquo;s absolutely surreal - thank you all again.</p><p>We want to make sure the community is aware we are listening and in touch, so for the format of this post and subsequent ones in the future I want to try something new. Consider Development Thoughts to be an honest brain dump of the team. Excuse us if it&rsquo;s a bit scattered in formatting.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2037" data-orig-width="3831"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/574bc8cc8b75c7a711668291090beed1/tumblr_inline_pp754bs4aT1rcwq50_540.png" data-orig-height="2037" data-orig-width="3831"/></figure><p><b>===Major Points===</b></p><p>Overall, we&rsquo;re ecstatic with the gameplay of Risk of Rain 2. There are some crashes we are trying our best to address, especially on game boot-up.</p><p>A goal we are currently trying to figure out is the most appropriate Customer Support path going forward. We&rsquo;ve been helping players manually, but a lot of players are falling through the cracks. DMing people through Discord isn&rsquo;t the most efficient. Will update everyone with info once it comes.</p><p>Another goal is a general roadmap for the game: what does the future of Risk of Rain 2 look like? How frequent are patches, compared to Content Updates? Will they be major chunks of content or trickling in over time? What would the community feel would keep the game the most enjoyable throughout Early Access?</p><p>We have internally finished a patch to address a lot of initial feedback and critical bugs - it is in QA and hopefully available to everyone early next week.</p><p><b>===Minor Points===</b><br/>• Happy with progression rate for classes - a touch faster than intended but still OK<br/>• Happy with Rainstorm difficulty - haven&rsquo;t seen much of Monsoon content to know. Drizzle is very easy but also fine.<br/>• Pleasantly surprised with people saying performance is good - have to narrow down why it runs poorly on some high-end machines<br/>• Happy with in-run decision making (3D Printers, Mountain Shrine, Order Shrine, etc). Should try to brainstorm more big decision points like this..<br/>• Happy that new teleporter event rules don&rsquo;t seem upsetting to RoR1 players<br/>• Curious about content distribution - are players progressing through unlocks too fast? How long do the more difficult item unlocks take?<br/>• Very happy with secret progressions - players are finding it at the ideal rate<br/>• Noting lots of feedback about 4+ player lobbies. Have to consider best way forward - most likely would be a private game only option with a disclaimer.<br/>• Noting sometimes monsters get stuck behind a closed door on Wetland Aspect<br/>• Noting people like going fast<br/>• Noting a lot of Quickplay Lobbies have an insane time to launch of 4000+ seconds<br/>• Noting people like ruining their build with Shrine of Order or 3D printer<br/>• Noting people want to be able to automatically continue sprinting after rolling<br/>• Noting people don&rsquo;t enjoy getting blasted as soon as they enter a stage</p><p><b>===Stuff we are working on===</b><br/>• Corrupted save file preventing people from playing is very high priority to fix - this is addressed in the Monday patch.<br/>• Happy with (mostly) class balance outside of MUL-T being a tad too strong. I think it&rsquo;s worth noting here that we have a stat per attack called it&rsquo;s &ldquo;proc coefficient&rdquo;, and it essentially defines how strong or frequent procs happen on an on-hit basis. MUL-T&rsquo;s nailgun has a low proc coefficient per nail of 0.4 compared to most character&rsquo;s 1.0, so he isn&rsquo;t proccing stuff a ton faster than other characters. <br/>• Very happy with Discord community aspect, but may need management help as it grows.<br/>• Imp Boss is a bit grindy, same with Worm<br/>• Some concerns about cheaters in Prismatic Trial. Excited for when seed rolls over.<br/>• Hearing loud &amp; clear about Teleporter being hard to see - want to make it still an aspect of the game without it feeling like a mistake. Players are not really noticing the passive particles - will start with a soft approach first.</p><p>Please let us know if we missed anything - our brains are a little frazzled right now. Again, thank you all SO much for the amazing launch day, and an enormous shout out to Gearbox for their absolutely great support and efforts. Crazy.</p><p>-Hopoo Games Team</p>

Title: DevBlog #2 - Frequently Asked Questions
<p>Hey! Thanks so much to all our fans for yesterday&rsquo;s wonderful response. We&rsquo;re glad that you&rsquo;re all excited for the game - we&rsquo;ll try our best to match the enthusiasm! Since we&rsquo;ve been receiving a lot of questions, we’ll actually just do two devblogs back to back and answer some of the more popular ones.<br/></p><p><b>Q:</b> How is the online multiplayer?<br/><b>A:</b> RoR2 was built from the ground up with networking in mind, and therefore it&rsquo;ll be a much smoother experience.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Will we still need to port-forward?<br/><b>A: </b>We can&rsquo;t say for sure until the functionality is done (working on it this week, actually) but it&rsquo;s a pretty good bet that port forwarding won&rsquo;t be necessary. We&rsquo;re striving for one-click connection via Steam.</p><p><b>Q: </b>Will all the characters be coming back?<br/><b>A: </b>

No - we haven&rsquo;t decided on who&rsquo;s coming back yet. Some characters (Commando, Engineer, etc) will be back because they have cool gameplay, while some might also come back because they&rsquo;re fan favorites (HAN-D, Acrid maybe? If he works well enough in 3D.) A lot of abilities are being reworked so they work in 3d as well, so there may be some spiritual successor classes.</p><p>Note: The unified character system mentioned in the first post isn&rsquo;t a
 replacement for classes. There are some exciting things we&rsquo;d like to do
 with it this time around now that we have it, however. We&rsquo;ll talk more 
about it soon.

</p><p><b>Q: </b>What engine is this being developed on?<br/><b>A:</b> It&rsquo;s being developed in Unity, which has been great to work with so far.<br/></p><p><b>Q:</b> What&rsquo;s the team size?<br/><b>A: </b>In office we have a team size of three, up from our previous of two (so its like a 50% bigger team!)</p><p><b>Q: </b>Is Chris coming back for the music?<br/><b>A: </b>Yes! We are very excited to be able to work with Chris again on the RoR2 OST. You can check out his twitter for all things music related: <a href="https://twitter.com/AstronautDown">AstronautDown</a> </p><p><b>Q:</b> Will this run on my toaster?<br/><b>A: </b>It&rsquo;s pretty early in development so we&rsquo;re not sure what the real performance requirements of RoR2 will be like yet. We&rsquo;ll be doing our best to make sure it runs well on as many machines as we can.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Will it have split-screen co-op?<br/><b>A:</b> At this point in development we can&rsquo;t say for sure. Having said that, we would love to be able to bring split-screen back and we know a lot of fans really enjoy it - we just don&rsquo;t know how that works in Unity yet. From what I&rsquo;ve seen of other games, it seems like 4 player co-op might be too taxing for consoles, but 2 player is likely. </p><p><b>Q:</b> Will artifacts (Glass, Command, Spite, etc) be coming back?<br/><b>A:</b> Yes - We will be bringing back some fan favorite artifacts as well as experimenting with new ones that we think would work well in a 3D environment (fun balls may or may not already be in the game..) <br/></p><figure data-orig-height="182" data-orig-width="168"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e60de704d704cb63ca0d3d9513c429b6/tumblr_inline_oppekxtN4s1rcwq50_540.png" data-orig-height="182" data-orig-width="168"/></figure>

Title: DEADBOLT Q&A
<p>I tried to answer every question as honestly as
I could, so I hope this is a good read. If your question isn’t there, it’s
either identical to another one asked or joined together with another question. Cheers!<br/></p><hr><p>Q: In total, how much time does the campaign of
Deadbolt span? It’s hard to tell, what with it being infinite nighttime and
all. </p><p>A: I would imagine a month-ish. It is implied
that the Candles are doing some sort of investigative work between missions,
which would surely take some time.<br/><br/>
Q: Did you have any major inspirations for the visual design of DEADBOLT? <br/>
A: John Wick is obviously the biggest one!<br/><br/>
Q: What would hopoo do if someone made a game completely based and inspired
from Deadbolt and its… Concept? (with permission and not) <br/>
A: There’s no way DEADBOLT is that unique in settings or thematics –
ultimately, you know what’s right and what’s wrong when you’re inspired by a
work, and so will everyone else! If you feel obligated to ask for permission, maybe
you’re not exploring enough original ideas? <br/><br/>
Q: When will we get modding? if so could
we get a simplified modding kit? Any plans for updating dedbort, even
just the map editor? Feature for adding custom sprites, rotation tool,
copypasta tool, just to name a few… <br/>
A: So the thing with that is that the map editor is only half the equation –
while the map editor may be writing stuff to files, it also has to be
interpreted on the end by the DEADBOLT game itself. Therefore, adding features
that aren’t supported in engine simply won’t work – it won’t know what youre
talking about. While rotation is supported in the engine, it doesn’t know how
to read that from the files, etc. I also am trying to avoid any legacy issues
where old maps are required for old versions of DEADBOLT, or vice versa.<br/><br/>
Q: When is deadbolt 2 coming with werewolves and mummies <br/>
A: Werewolves aren’t undead you dingus. But mummies could be cool.</p><p>Q: Will the stuff that came with the release of
Deadbolt on Play Station, will be added on PC? <br/>
A: Nope, that was sorta our deal-sweetener for getting on the Sony consoles.<br/><br/>
Q: Will we ever see expansion levels for Deadbolt or would we get Deadbolt 2
instead? <br/>
A: DEADBOLT 2 maybe sometime <br/><br/></p><p>Q: Does Ibzan is gay? <br/>
A: I haven’t really thought of the sexual orientation of any of the characters,
and I definitely don’t want to pull a JK Rowling and retroactively assign them.
So in terms of canon, that just hasn’t been explored.</p><p><br/>
Q: Would you prefer deadbolt 2 to be in 3d and 2d? Would you do a sequel? <br/>
A: DEADBOLT is probably the narrowest design space I’ve worked with – there’s
no dodging, insta death, insta travel attacks. By the end I felt very stretched
out in terms of enemy design, and for that alone I’d think 3D. But hey, I may
also just hate 3D by the end of RoR2 so who knows :^). I’d love to do a sequel
one day, most likely from the perspective of Ibzan. But who knows!<br/><br/>
Q: Did Ibzan want to kill the Fire, or just try to reconcile with it? <br/>
A: He just wanted to talk – but who knows what would’ve happened after the
Fireplace rejected him?<br/><br/>
Q: Would you be interested in going back to the world of deadbolt sometime in
the future? I remember hearing somewhere a 3D concept would be interesting to
work on. <br/>
A: I wish I was talented or driven enough to write comics for it – I think
DEADBOLT is more about the stories of individuals, compared to RoR who is a
story of the universe. I wrote the Cassette Tapes to reflect that.<br/><br/>
Q: Looking back, is there anything you’d change about Deadbolt? <br/>
A: Hmmm… I just wish I somehow could expand more on the lore and gangs, and
what their goals were. Gameplay-wise, it was a tad too short. I liked doing a
few standard stages, and then a mix-up stage (sniper, trap, boss, etc) – maybe
we could’ve fit in a few more rotations.<br/><br/>
Q: What’s your favourite loadout? <br/>
A: Death/Taxes and Flashbang, like a scrub.<br/><br/>
Q: Would you ever be interested in restarting the asset suggestion thread <br/>
A: I consider DEADBOLT to be done – as a 2 (now 3!) man team, we financially
can’t do the games-as-a-service thing like most big companies can for smaller
games like DEADBOLT. I also intended DEADBOLT to be a one-and-done thing as a
contrast for Risk of Rain, which we updated for years after release. </p><p>=CONTROVERSIAL OPINION ALERT= I personally also
think that EVERY game getting a bunch of DLCS and updates and patches for a
long time is, in a way, exhausting as a player. I think it makes it hard to
feel satisfied when you finished a game and it’s over and you feel completed in
the journey, knowing it’s not ~technically~ over until the devs stop patching.
I think it’s great for some games (mostly multiplayer-based ones), but some
games you just gotta let… finish, on a good note. Semi-open ended endings are
always unsatisfying, in my opinion, and so recently it just feels like you
don’t ever <i>complete</i> a game. …On the
flip side, we are planning on doing lots of post-launch support for RoR2
because it’s actually inline with our design goals, so don’t fret!<br/><br/>
Q: Will bugs like Scythe not having a
cover sprite or some enemies not having a falling sprite (which causes the game
to crash) be fixed? <br/>
A: Which enemies have been missing a falling sprite? They should be resorting
to idle, not crashing. Bosses?<br/><br/>
Q: Just wanted to say, you guys are my favorite
games studio, hands down. Now for the question: Now that the Reaper has
completed his task and is allowed to rest, what’s next? Is the Fireplace going
to keep him resting for a while? Does our MC have another task to accomplish? <br/>
A: The Fireplace has never let a reaper “rest” before - the reason he is
allowed to rest is because Ibzan never got to, and the Fireplace is trying
something different with you. This is unexplored territory for the both of them
– presumably he just pets his cat and gets bored before getting back to work.<br/><br/>
Q: What happens to everyone else in the
afterlife? <br/>
A: People who aren’t in the Place? Who knows, and who cares about boring happy
afterlife 😊<br/><br/>
Q: I had a question about the lore.
There’s mentions of places outside the city, across the river Styx. What are
they and what are they like? <br/>
A: The Styx connects the other realms together, including (presumably) wherever
the demons came from. This is explored lightly in one of the demon cassette
tapes.<br/><br/>
Q: Will you ever expand more on the world
of deadbolt or are you 100% done with it at this point? <br/>
A: Nope definitely not done, really wanna explore more one day<br/><br/>
Q: What’s your office address? For post
and stuff, maybe I want to send you a box full of A4 sheets of paper with a thousand
hoopters on each. <br/>
A: Maybe this is the paranoia in me but I’m not comfortable posting my address
online – you can just tweet it at me a thousand times instead<br/><br/>
Q: Did Ibzan think the flames would give
warmth to the Dredged or was he just lying to them and using them for his own
gain? <br/>
A: He was lying to himself, but he did truly believe that this was going to
work, because this (at the time, anyways) seemed like the only way out. Metaphor
woawoawo<br/><br/>
Q: Could you add some sorta DEADBOLT
reference into RoR2?  Will the Reaper be
playable in Risk of Rain 2 as a bonus?<br/>
A: Definitely references happening in some form, but playable might be
stretchin’ it a bit, especially since it’d be taking up the slot of some more
in-universe secret character.<br/><br/>
Q: How excited are for RoR2? <br/>
A: Honestly very nervous for the reception, with very big shoes to fill as a
sequel for RoR. I just hope people like it, and that we don’t get burnt on 3D
because there’s so many possibilities in the future for our games in 3D.<br/><br/>
Q: How are the Demons born? We know
they’re made in birthing chambers, but then is it just like humans or is there
anything specific needed for a demon to be born f.e. skeletons&gt;suicide,
zombies&gt;overdose, etc. <br/>
A: Demons aren’t undead and don’t naturally exist in the Place, which is why
they have to be smuggled over – they exist in whatever version of hell is in
the DEADBOLT universe, and are natural denizens of the underworld.<br/><br/>
Q: was izban hot before he died? <br/>
A: The hottest<br/><br/>
Q: do all the nightclubs canonically have
chris c. as the dj <br/>
A: Yes<br/><br/>
Q: I love Deadbolt very dearly and i’ve
listened to its soundtrack (particularly “Now I Am Become Death”)
more times than i can remember. What’s your favourite tune from Deadbolt ? <br/>
A: Defunktorum or The Proverbial Dust Biters<br/><br/>
Q: In the Hardmode Cassette Tape it talked
about a Reaper that wasn`t the current Reaper that we play as in the Game. Was
this Reaper Izban? Since in the tape, he talked about the fireplace as his
friend and that could be why he wanted to go back to the fireplace through the
portal at the end of the game, to revisit his friend. <br/>
A: Yes yes and yes. This was most heavily implied in Ibzan’s “home”, which
parallel yours.<br/><br/>
Q: Will RoR2 still have opportunities to
create silly messy builds like covering the screen in missiles or releasing an
endless stream of Thqwibs? If so, how are you working to mitigate the
performance impact of those crazy builds? <br/>
A: Yep! Currently we have a system that detects the average particle count in a
scene and slowly adds a chance non-important effects (like hitsparks or
impacts) don’t ever spawn. This will at some point also involve turning off
expensive effects and reducing particle LODs.<br/><br/>
Q: I really love the attention to detail
to the characters, environment, aesthetics and gameplay mechanics. Its themes
on the criminal underworld and the supernatural give a unique identity in a
high-octane/stealth pixel action game I have not seen before. Additionally what
prompted or inspired you to make DEADBOLT in the first place? <br/>
A: DEADBOLT in its entirety was supposed to be not-Risk of Rain. It’s a gorey,
violent, moody singleplayer puzzle-stealth game. We were just burnt out from
the Risk of Rain experience, and we also wanted to flex our design muscles a
bit and show that hey, we’re not just a one-trick pony of gamedevelopment :^)<br/><br/>
Q: I just played through this game on
PS4/Vita over the weekend. Huge fan of Risk of Rain. Even bought it through
Limited Run Games. So I had to pick up Deadbolt (Didn’t previously know you had
made it either.) and I love it. Its a super solid experience. I’m not sure I
have any questions about it. I guess I was curious if co-op multiplayer was
ever considered in development? Keep up the great work. Can’t wait to see what
you guys make next. <br/>
A: Nope, because of the reasons above – we wanted a single player game, since
RoR was a multiplayer one.<br/><br/>
Q: First of all, congratulations!! I
really loved the game since came out, I bought it for my birthday, since risk
of rain made me fell in love with all the pixel art in it, deadbolt didn’t
disappointed me!! Everything in it I love it! Thanks for the game!! Now the
question You already answered about how the skeletons or vampires came to be in
that Place, how the vampires are killed by their lovers, but, how a reaper,
becomes to be a reaper? I mean a candle said “I’ve never been so close to
one” <br/>
A: Originally, the reapers were actually supposed to be from suicides – if I
remember right, the reaper when going down the stairs to the docks still has
the hole in the back of his head in his sprite. Currently, it’s not explored
how a reaper is made – I think a bit of mystery is always needed in making a
believable universe J<br/><br/>
Q: Lorewise how many reapers are there
total? Why are they incredibly fragile compared to the undead? What makes the
reapers not undead? <br/>
A: IIRC there were 4 fireplaces in the final stage, which was supposed to
represent the way the fireplace was communicating to all reapers in the field.<br/><br/>
Q: Do you like turtles? How about corgis? <br/>
A: Yes, and yes (although there’s way too many in Seattle now).<br/><br/>
Q: Did you have any idea Chris would break
out a whole band’s worth of musicians for the soundtrack? His work was superb
and the OST remains my absolute favorite to this day. <br/>
A: DEADBOLT OST was actually done with many people – it must be in the credits
somewhere! If I remember right, there is at least a drummer and a musician.<br/></p><p>Thanks for all the questions, and happy hunting :)</p><p style="">hopoo<br/></p>

<h1>This blog did not and will not send requests for bitcoin donations. </h1>
<p>There seems to be a virus or some sort of malware going around causing blogs to “send out” chat messages to blogs that they follow asking for help with the purchase of certain items through donations of seemingly small amounts using bitcoin and adds a link to the message. </p>
<p>The message goes as following (at least the first message I got went like this): “Hi there buddy. I need help, I’m trying to buy a laptop and I can’t afford it. I’m about 0.36$ short, and I’d really appreciate if you could help me and transfer some money to me via bitcoin using this *link*.” </p>
<p>The small details in the message seems to have a few variations with the greeting, amount and purchased item showing up in different variations from formal to friendly, from 0.016 to 2$ and from a phone case to a laptop among others.</p>
<p>The blogs that are affected send out the messages to blogs that they follow for a long time mostly, so you are most likely to receive the message from a long time, active follower whose name you might recognize or a mutual etc. The blogs that are affected are not spam bots but actual active followers who follow the recipient for months or years and most likely the blogger who “sent” the message is unaware of the message being sent. </p>
<h1>DO NOT OPEN THE LINK.</h1>
<p>Opening up the link will cause the virus to spread even more and infect your computer/mobile with any sort of malware.</p>
<p>If you have received a message of that sort from this blog please know that it was not sent by me or within my control and ignore/delete the message without clicking the link.</p>

Title: RoR2 Q&A 12/2/17
<p>Since we got a million asks, I’ll collapse all the answers periodically into one giant QA so it doesn’t ruin your tumblr feed. I tried to answer every question - if yours isnt there, someone else might’ve asked the same question. Expand below to read!<br/></p><hr><!-- more --><p><b>Q:</b> Are
you thinking about putting out a beta version to test or are you just waiting
for the game to be fully released <br/><b>A:</b> Not sure exactly how we want to do it – we HAVE to have some way of getting
the game out to testers, especially for networking/matchmaking testing. It will
most likely be some form of closed/limited beta, but we really haven’t though
too much about it.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Any
ideas on what the system requirements could be? Will they be high or playable
on most machines? Also will it work with integrated graphics? <br/><b>A:</b> Most likely the game will be pretty light for GPU with our graphical style,
but CPU intensive. What that actually translates to won’t be until the game is
closer to launch, where we start optimizing.</p><p><b>Q:</b> ROR1
most loved thing me and my friends liked to do is ruining the framerate with
all the items that we had. we had lots of fun crashing the game for whoever
hosted the game. might this still be able to happen? I&rsquo;m looking forward to the
release anyway and so are my friends especialy with peer to peer now we can
connect better. <br/><b>A:</b> Uhh hopefuly you won’t be able to crash the game, but the game will still
scale infinitely like it did previously</p><p><b>Q:</b> Could
you make it so that when you use Unstable Watch and timestop, all colors in the
game become inverted for the duration? And if you want to go all the way with a
certain reference, have only Chef&rsquo;s cleavers stop in midair at the edge of a
radius from an enemy, and when the timestop ends the cleavers hit at the same
time. <br/><b>A:</b> No memes</p><p><b>Q: </b>Super excites for risk of rain 2. Im real glad i found
it in a steam summer sale, bought then and after that bought it for my ps4. Are
we going to see any new characters? (Bandit will always be fav so as long as
hes good im happy)<br/><b>A: </b>Yes, definitely new characters!</p><p><b>Q: </b>can
you make one of the new death messages be &ldquo;HOST WHEN?&rdquo; <br/><b>A: </b>No memes!!!!</p><p><b>Q:</b> While
Vita&rsquo;s out of the question, what about the Switch, which basically seems to
have slotted itself in the &lsquo;more powerful handheld device&rsquo; niche? <br/><b>A: </b>We’d obviously love to be on the switch, but that ultimately
depends on A. can we optimize the game to run on the Switch, and B. do we have
the technical know-how to actually get it running? Porting to consoles tends to
be a much more dramatic change than people expect, even if the engine natively
exports to it.</p><p><b>Q: </b>Hi. I’ve been a fan of risk of rain for the past few
years. I just want to ask: in risk of rain, some mechanics like heaven cracker
can pierce a line of enemies and the huntress’ ability to hit and run.
With the change from 2D to 3D  environment, how will they work? There
are many other abilities and mechanics that i also want to ask about, but these
two were the first ones that i could remember immediately.<br/><b>A: </b>We’re not going to bring back any mechanics that don’t fit just for the sake
of continuity – however, the Heaven Cracker I can see being actually more fun
in 3D since you have to actually align yourself with the enemies. Since everyone
can shoot and run in the 3D version, Huntress’ niche is sorta gone, but we have
some clever ideas to make that back</p><p><b>Q:</b> In
DevBlog #8 you explain some of the steam integration going into Risk of Rain 2
which will make a lot of people happy but will RoR2 also be available without
steam for those who prefer? For example will I be able to buy it on GOG like I
did RoR1, and play LAN games without steam? <br/><b>A:</b> Right now we’re focusing on making it work via Steam P2P, but (I believe)
that we haven’t done anything to explicity lock out connections via IP. You
just won’t get the same Nat punchthrough benefits (I’ll have to ask Jeff, our
network dude about it to make sure this is correct, but afaik I think that’s right)</p><p><b>Q:</b> Would
you guys happen to have an idea of when you think the game would be realeased? <br/><b>A:</b> Nope! Hopefully not too long!</p><p><b>Q:</b> Hello!
I loved Risk of Rain 1 and it is great to play with friends. I have two
questions (technically three, I&rsquo;m cheating). 1. I am assuming you&rsquo;re going to
release it on steam, so that said will there be steam multiplayer integration?
Like&hellip; Invite via steam, games are created with the help of steam
peer-to-peer. It was a pain to get 4 people playing on one server without port
forwarding. 2. Will there be a better way to keep track of items? 3. Can you
add a menu to see what items you have? <br/><b>A:</b> Yes, steam invites and all that are the goal. I know we talked about holding
TAB to expand the item menu so you could see more at once, but we haven’t
actually done that yet. I know it was a bit silly for it to be uncropped and
expanding off the screen.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Is
this still in development? <br/><b>A:</b> No we’re just pretending<br/></p><p><b>Q</b>: Are
you gonna have the same soundtrack from the first game? A different soundtrack?
A mix of both? (Don&rsquo;t get rid of the Dried Lake or Sunken Tombs songs). <br/><b>A:</b> That’ll ultimately be up to Chris, but I’m sure he’s in the same boat as us
and doesn’t want to cover the same ground that we did previously. </p><p><b>Q:</b> I was telling a friend how excited I was for this, and
he expressed a concern I’d like to ask you guys about. He said that, being 3D,
the game might end up either not as hectic as the first, or too hectic,
what with the hoards coming from all around you. What’s your take on this? (I’m
not actually too worried about it, but I still wanna hear your take on the
matter.)<br/><b>A:</b> Currently, we’re using SFX as a tool to present not only how close an enemy
is, but what state they’re in and how many there are. Since I’ve also been
playing the game for like a million hours I’ve also developed the ability to
recognize which enemy by the frequency of their screenshake… but that won’t be
relevant to most players. We’re really hoping to avoid radars or anything like
that for awareness.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Just
wanted to say, RoR2 is looking to be coming along fantastically. I really love
that you are constantly taking things in unexpected directions&ndash; I never
expected to see the game translated to 3D but you have done it and I can
imagine many hundreds of hours spent playing. Will Chris Christodoulou be
working on the music this game as well? <br/><b>A: </b>Yes, he will be back!</p><p><b>Q: </b>Have
you considered calling the second Risk of Rain &ldquo;Risk of Twain&rdquo;? <br/><b>A:</b> Not until now</p><p><b>Q: </b>This
is kind of a question and a half. How big will the RoR2 maps be and will all
the RoR1 maps return in 3D with the additions of new maps or just overall new
maps? <br/><b>A:</b> Overall we’re not really looking at the previous maps for the inspiration
for our new ones – we’re not making RoR 3D, but a sequel, so we don’t really
want to recreate too much old stuff!</p><p><b>Q: </b>Since
RoR2 is moving to more dynamic network model, how will people with screwy NATs
be affected? NAT Punchthrough is great and all, but if implemented incorrectly
can lead to multiple users on the same NAT being unable to join servers outside
of the NAT (See Rainbow Six Siege). Will users still be able to host dedicated
servers like the old game? What does this mean for users buying the game
through GOG/Humble Bundle? Really hope everything goes swimmingly because port
forwarding sucks. <br/><b>A: </b>This is the exact reason that we will have to have some form of limited
beta, because this is something that we can’t recreate in office. I honestly
don’t know enough to respond accurately on what would happen in that particular
situation, but thanks for the heads up</p><p><b>Q:</b> Relative
to the first one, will Risk of Rain 2 be a sequel, prequel, completely
unrelated, or even have story at all? <br/><b>A:</b> Sequel!</p><p><b>Q:</b> How
were you going to implement artifacts this time around? Is it going to be based
around areas that are randomly generated and you sometimes have access, or
multiple spawn locations, etc. <br/><b>A:  </b>Dunno, we haven’t implemented really
any form of map permutations yet. The artifacts also ended up taking a much
more important role in the game than we initially expected – not sure if the
old way of unlocking is strange if it’s to be a core feature.</p><p><b>Q:</b> (Big
fan) I just had some curious questions; How many characters do you intend there
to be in RoR2?, How differently do you plan on changing the previous
characters?, Any hints on the final boss? pls, What is the estimated price of
the game? and will their be any chance of PvP? Cannot wait, super hyped and
keep up the great work :D <br/><b>A:</b> We’re aiming for 10 characters on launch. No spoilers or hints! Definitely
not PvP in any official capacity since the networking structure wasn’t designed
for a good PvP experience. </p><p><b>Q:</b> I&rsquo;ve got three questions : 1) Will
it be called RoR2 or will you find / have you found something else ? 2) Why the
hell is there one more 'o&rsquo; in the tumblr URL than in the actual 'Hopoo&rsquo; name ?
3) What&rsquo;s the average of the team&rsquo;s favorite meals ? thx xoxo &lt;3 <br/><b>A:</b> I think it’ll just be RoR2. The hopoo tumblr was taken on creation of this
tumblr, so we had to make it hopooo instead ☹</p><p><b>Q:</b> Will RoR2 reveal why the Contact
Light was carrying a teleporter linked to a planet crammed with hostile
lifeforms? <br/><b>A: </b>I’d like to explore what the heck is up with the humans in this game, but I
sorta wish I had a better avenue that’s not just item logs and monster logs. </p><p><b>Q:</b> I&rsquo;m going to ask the real questions,
is Sniper a man or woman? This is important because reasons.<br/><b>A: </b></p><p><b>Q: </b>Theres something that confuses me
alot about risk of rain 2. It&rsquo;s the lore. If the characters have left the
planet, why would they come back? <br/><b>A:</b> Canonically, the returning characters were never on the Contact Light to
begin with (and presumably there could totally be like, a bunch of engineers
and commando suits.)</p>

I&rsquo;m a programmer with very little art talent. I can make some pixel art 
in Photoshop, but it doesn&rsquo;t look all that great. Do you have any tips 
for beginners on how to get to a point to make art as nice as yours?<br/><b>A: </b>My drawings are all done in Paint, but animated in GraphicsGale (the layers + onion skinning comes useful. It comes surprising to hear that my art is nice; I was in the exact same position as you only a few years ago!

prequel once you finish deadbolt? If so, would you be planning on mod 
support for the next game?<b><b><br/>A: </b></b>I really /do/ want mod support for future games, but GM essentially doesnt support it at all, so I’d have to hire a coder to code in a different engine, which might be too hard with our small (read: like 2) team size</p><p><br/></p><p><b><b>Q: </b></b>If a fan made a game with a similar playstyle to risk of rain, which item/character would you want them to reference?<b><b><br/>A: </b></b>Hmm..

<p>The game is still very touch-and-go, so no plans to where it heads. I&rsquo;d like to keep the game single-player; partially because of my incompetence in net coding, but also partially because you have to begin sacrificing elements to make a game multiplayer.<br/><br/>As for a kickstarter, probably not. I don&rsquo;t have a particular reason to do one, as funding is no longer an issue. While it <em>is</em> a convenient platform for pre-order rewards and publicity, it just wouldn&rsquo;t be very right to ask for money I don&rsquo;t need.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;ll post alphas once the game is in a decent state, just like I did for Risk of Rain. Any ideas for names?</p>

Title: Answering some questions on Deadbolt
<p>Hey, got a sudden influx of asks, and a lot of them are the same, so here ya go.</p><p>Q: Will the game come out on Mac?</p><p>A: Most likely yes, that and Linux, seeing as GM exports to both. Probably not the alpha builds though, because I don’t easily have a Mac on hand</p><p>Q: Will the game be finished/when will it be updated?</p><p>A: Yes, the game will be finished! The current plan for development is similar to Risk of Rain’s; release early alpha builds on here, get a 
bunch of feedback, go into closed/private beta, and launch on Steam. I’ll update periodically when I need more feedback on stuff, since it kinda slows down development to tend builds</p><p>Q: Where can I follow the game?</p><p>A: Here is fine! I have a tigthread that I’m totally neglecting, but I’ll try to get better at updating all my random social media</p><p>Q: Kickstarter?</p><p>A: Nah, I got $$$ already B)<br/></p><p>Q: The game doesn’t fit on my screen!</p><p>A: Yeah, sorry :&lt; I admit I didn’t think I’d get really over 20 downloads on the build, let alone 22,000 (that took like 9 months for RoR to get that many), so right now it’s hard-coded to a resolution. Whoops!<br/></p>

<p>While RoR finishes up on the Linux/Mac end, I started some progress on (what will probably become) my next project <em>sorry its not necrogame</em>. I wanted something very low-key while I finished college, so I&rsquo;m going for a game with smaller scope. I talked about the idea in a <a href="http://hopooo.tumblr.com/post/94998446214/more-game-ideas-yay-for-not-sleeping-plot-is-that">previous blog</a></p>
<p>Any ideas for names?</p>

Title: More questions
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Will this soon be able to update on its own<br/><strong>A: </strong>That would depend on our distribution platform. If we ever get on Steam, then it would be able to do so. We are looking at a few other platforms as well!</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Awesome game so far! There is one balancing suggestion i have; it seems that a couple of the items, especially the missile launcher, becomes very OP once you have a couple of them. Also I&rsquo;d say the jet pack removes too much of the potential to be damaged once you have a few. Would you consider looking into nerfing these items a bit more to balance the late-game play?<br/><strong>A: </strong>I don&rsquo;t particularly mind there being a few &lsquo;op&rsquo; items because you have no control over what you choose. The reason the missile launcher hits so hard is because it only hits one enemy; later on, when theres a bunch of enemies at once, it isn&rsquo;t as useful except for against bosses, and I think that&rsquo;s okay! Jetpack should also be fine because it doesn&rsquo;t inherently give any defense or damage, just utility.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Hay, My Items Thing Isnty Working. I get an item and it doesnt unlock&hellip; I guess this is a bug report<br/><strong>A: </strong>Yep, its kind of buggy. Already fixed for next update.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>The giant portal in the snow level must do something right? I wanted to find out. So I did this: http://imgur.com/0SXWupd   is what I got up too. And I dont think I can handle it any more. I’ve been at ‘Hahahah’ for ove 30 minutes. I give up.<br/><strong>A:</strong> Because the game is still in alpha, there is nothing past that level. Don&rsquo;t worry; once the game is closer to release, you&rsquo;ll know everything about it :-)</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>I want to applaud you for this game. Someone gave it to me on a USB and it has been spreading like wildfire at our school. Seriously, we haven&rsquo;t had an epidemic like this since CoD 1. Keep up the good work. -Your friend in Australia.<br/><strong>A:</strong> As someone who did the same thing (USB games) years ago I find that story very funny :-) Glad to hear we have fans all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Are there any new classes in the works? I personally love this game but I can see myself getting bored of it after playing the 2 characters a million times. Keep up the good work!<br/><strong>A: </strong>Absolutely!</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>Hey, love the game! I was wondering what you language / tool you created it with?<br/><strong>A:</strong>Gamemaker 8.0</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>There a glitch (I think its a glitch) where the game switches my control style to gamepad, even though I&rsquo;m using a keyboard. Easily fixed by setting the gamepad mode off, but a slight irritant that I thought I should bring up<br/><strong>A:</strong>Yes, its been fixed for next update. It happens when you go back to the menu using the ESC option from in-game.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>I noticed that when you start off you always start off in Desolate forest is it always going to be like this or are you going to change which Levels you spawn in?<br/><strong>A:</strong>Thanks for asking! We will have multiple 'tiers&rsquo; of maps that the game will choose from, so you don&rsquo;t always play through the same maps every game.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I love this game so, so much.<br/><strong>A:</strong> :-)</p>

Thanks to all our fans for making it possible.</strong><strong><br/><br/>We also have a sudden influx of questions in our inbox, so here&rsquo;s some answers:<br/><br/>Q: </strong>Any plans on including multiplayer? That would be tits. <br/><strong>A:</strong> As tits as that would be, it would require re-working our entire game from the ground up, so we doubt any traditional online multiplayer will exist. We MIGHT be able to fudge in some kind of splitscreen/dual controller though!<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>Hey I have a problem when i first get on the the game the Resolution is too small to see. <br/><strong>A: </strong>You can change the scaling in the option (top right of the main screen, or hit ESC in-game)<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>I love the game but it would be much better if it had an upgrading system outside of the game, like every game you finish you gain exp based on highscore or something then you level up (on menu screen) then you get skill points/gold to buy skills such as when starting the game you get like 10 more health, up to 50 every skill level, and other stuff like 10% attack speed at maxed level, 10 damage at maxed level and so on, if you know what I mean, it would help a lot on hardcore mode. <br/><strong>A:</strong> We shy away from that because it would require grinding, and would make the game easier on subsequent playthroughs (which it already does by just becoming better at the game.) The need to feel like you are achieving something/making progress should be fulfilled when we start adding achievements to unlock items/classes/etc!<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>Will this be released on Mac at any point? I understand the key audience would be PC users but I&rsquo;d love to play it and (as my question should make obvious) I have a Mac <br/><strong>A:</strong> It is planned for Mac, yes. I don&rsquo;t quite know how stable GM for Mac is, but we hope for a playable Mac version around the time of our Kickstarter. We even got a Mac specifically to test a Mac build.<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>Will Risk of Rain be available for console (PSN to specific)? <br/><strong>A:</strong> Since GameMaker can&rsquo;t export to consoles, that probably won&rsquo;t happen :-(<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>Will there be CO-OP, Level Editors and possible mod support? <br/><strong>A:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know what kind of tools would be needed for modding. A level editor isn&rsquo;t on the list either (there are a lot of things on the list!) but would be really awesome to do.<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>I just had two bosses spawn after activating the teleporter on the first stage, is this supposed to happen sometimes? Amazing game btw, can&rsquo;t wait to see how this one grows, it&rsquo;s sure to be a cult classic. <br/><strong>A:</strong> Yep, multiple bosses can spawn depending on how far in you are. Bosses can be selected to spawn just like normal monsters can, they are just more &lsquo;expensive&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for all your support. Its very exciting to see our game develop a growing fanbase :-)</p>

Title: Glovepie script - Play with a Wii Classic Controller.
<p>I used this yesterday to play with my wii classic controller instead of the keyboard. you may want to have a look at it.</p>
<p>To make this run you need to connect your wii controller to the computer with a bluetooth thingy, by using bluesoleil or anything else. Then you need to download glovepie, copy paste this script (<a href="http://pastebin.com/mSEg7LTS">http://pastebin.com/mSEg7LTS</a>) click run, and you&rsquo;re set.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Q: Why dont you post in AGDG anymore? I heard you got banned or something&hellip; Just use tor, it will change your ip, and it worked for me! </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br/> A: I was only banned for a few days, and have been busy with midterms lately to post any real progress. Don’t worry!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br/><br/> Q: Managed to get a solid playthrough of about 5-6 levels repeating the snow level several times, dying due to carelessness while trying to kill my third or fourth mass of Vagrants. For boss variety have you considered super versions of bosses instead of lots of one boss? As well as player sized bosses? Also the jellyfish doesn&rsquo;t really fit a snow level, have you considered a snow themed boss like a yeti? To sum it up, what are your plans regarding future bosses? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br/> A: The bosses do have ‘super’ versions in that they can spawn with affixes; did you see red, yellow, orange, and blue vagrants? If not, it may have been a glitch.<br/><br/> The snow level is far far from being finished; I plan on reintroducing at least one new boss every level, while cycling out the old ones from previous levels so it didn’t become stagnant. The snow level’s purpose in the latest build was to test how it felt; was it too large? Too empty? Too crowded?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Q: Will there be random quests?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br/> A: That is an interesting thought. I agree that there needs to be more risk/reward inside the game, and some kind of quest-ish option may be fun. What I don’t want is something like ‘Kill 10 Lizards: Receive 20 Exp.’ A quest may be more like a challenge that you have to accomplish in a short time, not a grind (especially in a time-based game like this.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br/><br/> Q: Will there be unlock able characters or just skins?<br/><br/> A: Yes, there will be unlockable characters with all new skills. While during alpha testing they will be presented unlocked, in the game you will have to complete certain tasks to unlock them (for example, you will have to beat the entire game to unlock a new class.)<br/><br/></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br/> Q: How many bosses/enemy variants will there be?<br/><br/></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A: This is hard to answer! It really depends on how many we can fit; we want to make sure that every level feels different to another. I’m aiming for every level to have unique monsters but one; for example, level one and level two will only share one monster type. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I haven’t begun filling the game with content yet because we are ironing down all the gameplay mechanics, and going back and fixing old mechanics will be harder with ~20 monsters already included.<br/><br/><br/> Q: Kickstarter? Do you plan on including an enemy log? Preorders? Thank you, I really love this game so far.<br/><br/> A: A Kickstarter is a nice goal but ultimately farther along. As for preorders, we really don’t have any financial plans set in stone either. Not only that, but I would feel obligated to rush the game if I had a lot of preorders waiting, which would reduce the quality. It’ll be done when its done!<br/><br/> An enemy log is planned, very similar to the item log.<br/><br/> Thank you for all the question and interest in the game! If you have any more, please submit!<br/><br/></p>

Title: Risk of Rain: What is it?
<p><br/>For those unfamilar with the roguelike(like) genre, it is characterized primarily by randomized gameplay and permanent death. <br/><br/>However, most players find the genre hard to jump into: it is usually exceedingly complex. Risk of Rain aims to revitalize the genre with stylized graphics and an intuitive gameplay scheme that teaches itself, rather then having to be taught.</p>
<p>The three main goals for our game are simple:<br/><br/> 1. Design a game that is randomly generated every play-through, to keep replayability high and fresh.<br/><br/> 2. Time = difficulty. The longer you play, the harder the game gets.<br/><br/>3. Be enjoyable, regardless of whether you win or lose.<br/><br/><img src="http://i47.tinypic.com/2462ft3.png"/><br/><br/> Monster spawning, item spawning, even where you spawn in the map is randomly generated. No game will ever be the same as another. Playing more and completing challenges will unlock more content, thrown into the “pool” of random generation once players become comfortable. <br/><br/>More details will be upcoming! <br/><br/></p>

<p>As a proud member of the Southern Hemisphere of this wonderful globe of ours, I was just wondering what the 'Summer', 'Fall', etc in the roadmap are referring to. Is Summer the Northern Hemisphere Summer? In addition, are there any more concrete dates for the Skills 2.0 update now that the first update is out, and more importantly, what sort of feedback are you looking for from the community until then?</p>
<p>Yes, sorry this is Northern hemisphere summer. Next update is coming in September.<br/><br/>In terms of feedback, QOL is typically the most actionable one. We do listen for overall community ~feeling~ on things like balance, but QOL is stuff we would individiually address</p>

<p>Stop saying soon give us real updates and don't say stay tuned to our social media then not use said social media for two days. Why can't you just say that "QA found some bugs and we are working on them" why do have go soonTM soonR say tuned soooooonnnn and then nothing. I know you dont even read these but what else can we do you don't responded to anything </p>
<p>Fair question - first, I’ll assume that this response is presumably coming from a place of excitement.<br/><br/>The reason we say “Soon” is because <i>we actually don’t know when outside of it being actually soon -</i> when we went to E3, we were hoping to have it approved by QA by then, but it actually wasn’t because the build was a bit bigger than expected.<br/><br/>We don’t want to set dates and then have to push them back, so we opt to not have dates at all until its 100% ready. It’s not to be super cool and hype it up - <i>however</i>, it’s possible that maybe we’re being a bit TOO cautious on that front. <br/><br/>Please keep letting us know how you feel, its really important! We’ve never really had a live game before, so this is something we’re learning to do as well.</p>

There are currently four open slots for characters, all of which will be filled by the time of release. Are you planning on continuing to add content after the game has been released? Have you considered making payed DLC? If you are going to make more content, will there be a steady release schedule, or will it be mostly by ear?
<p>Yes, we plan to support post-release! As for the structure of it&hellip; I dunno, if I’m being entirely honest. We’re just focusing on our content patches - we will most likely see how those pan out first. I think that Early Access is a big learning experience for us, and hopefully we can adjust as we go for what the community wants<br/></p>

<p>I still think its a neat gimmick to go into FPS mode, but it most likely wouldn’t resemble very closely to what the Sniper was like in RoR1 at all.<br/></p>

This is kind of a question/feedback, but I was wondering if the future characters are planned to be designed with more team-play in mind? I find that the multiplayer in ror1 felt kind of the same as playing by yourself because there were very few characters with support skills (acrid speed buff being the exception, and enforcer technically aside from being so bad that you couldn't really play him), and ror2 seems like a good opportunity to remedy that. New engineer is a good start, but only 1/6.
<p>Ultimately each class is supposed to be fully functional in singleplayer, which makes a dedicated support-style class difficult. BUT we hope our next character pushes the envelope a bit farther!<br/></p>

We also have a ton of help from Gearbox in terms of QA, PR, marketing, etc.<br/><br/>In terms of recruiting, not really - if it’s going well, why rock the boat? However, we HAVE begun shopping around a bit to see if we can contract out any work to help make the game bigger. Nothing on that front yet.<br/></p>

<p>We’re at ~70%ish of the content. Pretty much all the features are in, but some (splitscreen is a likely example) will trickle in over time. We also want to make sure that we have enough room to pivot from early access feedback - so if we expand the scope of the game’s content, it would represent less than 70%.<br/></p>

<p>I’ll have to be honest - we aren’t launching with Mac and Linux. We just don’t really have the time to do so :&lt;<br/><br/>Not just that, but we’re also aiming to launch a much more stable and higher quality game this time around - we would want to make sure that if we did a Mac or Linux build, that it was just as good as the Windows one, and we don’t have any Linux experts in our team yet.<br/></p>

Hello! I am a ror1 player who has been in live with your art style and when I found out about ror2 not too long ago I was geeked to see it coming to 3d.

I need to bulk up my portfolio with work in gamrs and cant seem to break into the game development scene. I would love to be able to model any concepts
<p>I truly appreciate the offer - but not only are we OK, I also think that it’s a slippery slope for us to start accepting free work that SHOULD be paid for.<br/><br/>If you’re interested in dipping your toes in, I know that modding and workshop content for games is a great way to not only practice art, but to actually apply and implement it. You’ll learn a ton that way, and I know that occasionally modders have gotten full-time offers from their work!<br/><br/><br/></p>

Your last statement said: "Plan is still 2019 - we’ll let you know when we are more confident of a date!". While earlier post said: "We are planning on launching in Early Access in Q1 next year." and "We want to be as transparent as possible with what we’re working on and what we will work on". The most recent statement gives me the impression that there is a chance the beta could be pushed back to 2020 and its been a while since we have had a post about how the game is progressing. So whats up?
<p>The game is progressing great! I understand the anxiety between updates, but generally it’s difficult to both make a post and work on the game, especially since we are spending most of our time polishing existing content, which doesn’t lead to very interesting posts. As we get closer to Early Access, we also don’t want to spoil too much of the content we have to show you guys - we want you to find it yourself! :)<br/><br/>To reiterate, we have not changed from our plan of Q1 2019, but most likely it will be near the end of Q1, so don’t be refreshin’ this page all the time!<br/></p>

<p>Honestly, we just made them up for now. We’ll update them closer to release. The game still requires optimization, but we still plan to target it functioning on low-end machines. For reference, we develop using i5, 16gb ram, and GTX 960 (I think).<br/></p>

speaking on that ask about offscreen attacks, it seems like your system is very sound effect reliant which is fine but also could be a problem for anyone who is hearing impaired or deaf or who just want to listen to their own music and not hear the game. Perhaps a good way to solve this is to have enemies aggression level raise or lower depending on if you are looking at them and to not have them perform ranged attacks until they are first seen so that it's easier to keep track of threats.
<p>I’ve been thinking about the hearing-impaired, but I couldn’t think of a super good solution outside of like, red arrows when enemies are nearby, but that still doesn’t totally give the same set of information<br/><br/>Also since I’ve played 1000 hours of the game, I can actually tell what enemy is around by the frequency and strength of the screenshakes, but that’s not really expected for the player to learn<br/></p>

<p>We generally use:<br/><br/>-Targeting lasers, when applicable<br/></p><p>-Distinct charge up SFX</p><p>-Distinct idle barking/footstep SFX</p><p>-Screenshake</p><p>-Post-process Volumes</p><p>To indicate the presence of an enemy and how close they are. It seems to work well enough, and the SFX isn’t so subtle that you can’t hear it if you have music playing.<br/></p>

<p>The big drone shown in the video is a special drone - the small drones still exist in the game, and glimpses of them can be seen in the trailer!</p>

Hi! I've been quite curious to some of the settings you use in blender and how you render your models. In game it looks like the characters are low-poly with but the materials are shadeless. Is my theory correct? Maybe you can't answer, I'm just curious! 
<p>I wouldn’t say low-poly, but more like mid-poly. It’s ~5k a character, and most enemy models use a baked normal map as well.<br/><br/>We actually use a modified version of the deferred pipeline (so we can use a lot of point lights on projectiles, effects, etc.) We use one of our gbuffer channels as a reference to a ramp to remap our NdotL values to - so most character’s use a two-tone ramp, but the environment uses a very soft ramp. You can also use a ramp that doesn’t end in black for a fake subsurface effect. The effect is a bit subtle, but it adds a lot in terms of making characters contrast more. Below is an example of the character ramp (center) compared to 2 environment ramps (side). Take note on how the light terminates. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SgAfojj.png">Full size.</a><br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1073" data-orig-height="466" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/3554f03d7793bd74a121f8afd95da563/tumblr_inline_pcyanjcR1M1rcwq50_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1073" data-orig-height="466"/></figure><p> I suspect this is the way BoTW also does their deferred pipeline, because of this bug that someone found.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-height="720" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/740af80a6c42e45136dec09d8070174b/tumblr_inline_pcyaep2IpT1rcwq50_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-height="720"/></figure>

<p>It currently has matchmaking and P2P through Steam - so no hamachi or port forward crap. At some point we want the option for people to host dedicated servers, but we haven’t fully explored that yet<br/></p>

Reblog name: 
RoR 1 was really good, but it did sometimes feel that if you got ahead of the difficulty curve in terms of itemization then enemy difficulty would never catch up again (because they keep feeding you items)... Is there any chance of RoR2 either including endlessly-scaling difficulty, or some sort of "AI-director" to occasionally pump up the difficulty for a brief moments if players seem unchallenged?
<p>That definitely did (and still does) happen.<br/><br/>I think in theory it’d be nice if the director could realize this, but also in some ways it would be a bit demotivating if you did really well and the game “punished” you for it. In some ways, it’s your reward. But it would be nice if there was still a challenge.<br/><br/>I think some light touches would be great, we just can’t think of any great calculations that wouldn’t go awry. Things like average monster count might be a decent indicator?<br/></p>

<p>We don’t really have a selection of characters that we’ve pre planned to be in the game, we sorta just make it up as we go along and see if the kit is interesting in 3D or the character its cool enough we can rework their kit<br/><br/>Having said that, I feel like the merc is the only melee class who can actually have the same kit and still work in 3d, assuming he can dash directionally. The fantasty is obviously for it to become a DmC style character with interrupts and juggles&hellip; but that’s probably not feasible with our skill level :x<br/></p>

Does that mean there are Items that can be picked up by all players? If I pay to open a chest, or kill a Boss (and they drop something), does everyone get the Item?
<p>currently bosses drop an item for each player alive, and they’re all the same type when dropped</p>

Now that you folks have moved to being a fully 3D game, how are you handling aiming in a 3D environment? Will it feel like a third person shooter? Will different weapon types such as lock-on, boomerangs, and weapons with penetration still behave like they did in RoR 1?
<p>I would consider the role of aiming in RoR2 being less about “am I going to hit him or am I going to miss” and being more like “do I shoot X or do I shoot Y?” Target selection rather than accurate aiming. The monsters are pretty huge so its fairly difficult to miss (although currently the wisps are sorta causing havoc - we’ll see how that ends up)<br/></p>

A sizeable amount of the community agrees that the biggest downfall of RoR was the inabilty to join games after they've already started or the inability to rejoin after a connection drop. Will the ability to join or rejoin ongoing games ve present in RoR2?
<p>Yep, rejoining currently works! Another thing we’re aware of was how shitty it was when you died early and couldn’t catch up to your friends - resulting in more dying. We don’t have a solution yet for the item discrepancy, but currently exp is actually shared across a team so you’ll at least be all at the same level (and your drones will level up with you as well!)<br/></p>

<p>Yes, it’s a sequel not a 3D remake. So new items, monsters, bosses, characters, etc. Aiming for a similar count for characters and items. If something doesn’t work in 3D as well as it did in 2D then it’ll either get reworked or scrapped. The story is mega loose atm but currently it takes place post-RoR1 events. Canonically, not every character available in RoR1 was on the Contact Light<br/></p>

In Devblog #3 you say that PvP isn't going to be in the game. Is that written in stone for now, or is that just for the current development phase? Surely if players will be able to take control of monsters, that could be grounds for a sort of asynchronus mode of PvP where a player takes control of an "elite" or "assassin" monster that would have items too. Is PvP just off the menu?
<p>Generally speaking, in networking a portion of the control is given to the client (your local version of the game) and the rest is given to the server (the over-the-internet master version of the game.) Making things client authoritative makes it feel more responsive and correct for the local player, but making things server authoritative makes it fairer and less susceptible to cheating. Since this is a PvE game, that means that we can give the client a bunch more authority (and therefore a much smoother experience) since the monsters won’t complain about lag compensation, getting shot around walls, etc. However, that means that if there WAS PvP, it would simply be unfair because the server trusts the client too much to report hits, among other things. <br/></p><p>So yeah, it could “functionally” support PvP, but it would be no fun even for screwing around. Also none of the items nor abilities given to the player-controlled characters are intended to be fair on the receiving end. It would just be not fun.<br/></p>

Hi there, I've started doing cosplay based on your RoR characters (drawn by tink29 on deviantart) and gotta ask you- will there be significant difference between RoR1 and RoR2 character design? Because it will be quite sad if in the final game Bandit's cape for example will suddenly change from blue (or yellow, in tink29's case) to some crazy color =|  Big fan, Have a nice day. (if you can't answer here, please feel free to answer in Private Message twitter /HolySerega)
<p>Sorta - there’s some elements that needed to be added to better accentuate form, which is unique to 3D when things can be looked at at different angles. Some parts of characters are also very non-descript in RoR1 or physically impossible to animate (the engineer’s shoulder cannons are now mounted on “arms”, which allows for more expressive animations and degrees of freedom). Generally though, the engineer isn’t going to turn yellow unless he’s a spiritual successor and a new character entirely<br/></p>

My initial reaction when I heard that RoR 2 was going to be 3D was concern for the team that had been employed for the initial game. Since you guys are a small company, were employees, such as the artists, let go or were they required to now translate their skills from a 2d medium to 3d? how did things change exactly production wise from the first game to the new one? Thanks
<p>Cute! The initial team for RoR was:<br/>Duncan “Hopoo” (me)<br/>Paul “Paulthegoat” <br/>Matt “Leth”<br/>Chris Christodoulou <br/></p><p>now it’s<br/>
Duncan “Hopoo” (me)<br/>Paul “Paulthegoat” <br/>Jeff “ghor”<br/>Chris Christodoulou 

<br/></p><p>So yeah, the team is pretty much the same. I’ve been practicing 3D art for quite a few months for the transition (and still a lot to learn - getting better every week!)<br/></p>

Hey, a few days ago, I bought, binged, and beat Deadbolt, (Amazing game, I am going to try out the Risk of Rain game you made soon!), but, I am a bit confused on some things. Who exactly was our character before they became a reaper? Did he choose to become a reaper, or was he chosen? Or is it one of those situations where you left it open to come up with your own backstory for him? I just loved the small musings and bits of dialogue he has, and I would like to learn more about him. Thank you :D
<p>The origins of who and how reaper(s) are chosen are left unanswered in the game, because I think its too important to tack into some log somewhere. Originally, before the skeletons were in the game, reapers were created from suicide - there used (maybe still is?) a small bullet hole in the back of the reaper’s head that you could only see if when you went down the stairs to the docks. Timur the Tinkerer’s icon was actually a repurposed icon from the first reaper you’d fight against, who committed suicide via shotgun (hence the missing chunks, jaw, and the bullet holes in the back of the head.) <br/></p><p>Yeah.<br/></p>

Is there a particular way Ibzan decides where to teleport to after each 'death'? I'm wondering if he can be properly used in custom levels, but I haven't done a whole lot of tests regarding his behaviours, so I don't know if he can get stuck in a wall or floor or something like that.
<p>I believe he teleports to the nearest room that’s at least a certain distance away (400 pixels?). I used to have an issue in testing where on the final level, Ibzan kept teleporting downstairs to where the fireplace was and noone could find him - thematically interesting, but unintended! <br/></p>

I saw DEADBOLT in the latest humble bundle today and I was wondering at what point do you/your publisher decide to offer the game at a discounted price or in a bundle? Is it more profitable, or just a way to let more people play the game? I first came across ror through a bundle, and found it was the best way to get my friends to get the game as well. Thanks!
<p>No publisher for this one, so just up to me! Generally speaking, when you sell a game at a discount/bundle, you’re trading (potentially) the cash you would’ve received at full price for fans and people who have heard of your game. We practically give away Risk of Rain because at this point having more people who have heard and played the game is more important than the money we receive from it.<br/></p>

I really wish I could've just sat down and talked it out with Ibzan. The fire might've been mad, but I wasn't :^) - I mean, after all, it was the fire's fault Ibzan offed himself. He was bored to death. (Hehe) Anyways, what were your previous ideas for an ending / final battle?
<p>A long time ago each gang had its own reaper leader, but that ended up making the gang feel incompetent (the zombies are lead by reapers, vampires by reapers&hellip;). Ibzan is sort of the left over of that idea, and is half-skele reaper hybrid so he still feels connected with his gang.<br/></p>

Do you ever plan on doing something more with RoR? Its one of my favourite games (so is deadbolt) and I love the lore, but there is a lot left unsaid, such as a lot with the the teleporters and such, maybe not a game but a comic or something?
<p>Sadly I don’t have the connections nor the resource to really reach out and get 3rd party stuff done, which sucks because it’s like super fanart which I love. I think both universes have fantastic places to be expanded - maybe in the future we can get something done!<br/></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been working on our new game for a couple months now. All under wraps until it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re proud of, but 2017 should definitely be an exciting year for us!</p>

<p>As far as I’m aware, there’s no magical way to give a game mod support post-launch, even with GM. It’s something that really REALLY should be planned from step 1 (like online multiplayer cough coughoacuhco)<br/></p>

<p>Thanks for the concern! I&rsquo;m actually very very proud of all our games, to be honest. I don&rsquo;t think that saying some things didn&rsquo;t work or could be better is a bad thing - I think it&rsquo;s a good trait to learn as a game developer! A lot of times it&rsquo;s hard to let go of concepts that you just really want to make work, just because it&rsquo;s your baby. Sometimes you gotta take a step back and be like &ldquo;yeah this just isn&rsquo;t gonna work&rdquo; or &ldquo;this feels kinda janky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt really limited by the design space of DEADBOLT (1.5D instant death hitscan enemies) - near the end I wasn’t too satisfied with the enemy designs, and I could feel them becoming more and more convoluted. If I did a sequel I really think a stealth-FPS would be an interesting take for it. Perspective of Ibzan as a reaper, maybe?<br/></p>

I have been looking through the graphics and I found some quite interesting content there. Mainly I would like to know more details about the "interrogating" scene with Puff and why did the stripper Succubus and the alternative succubus were scrapped
<p>The interrogation thing used to be a mini-game where you’d have to smack him till little icons matched up. This was during the time where I considered not being able to see in rooms you weren’t in, but you could interrogate enemies to get kinda faint outlines of whats going on in other rooms. I took it out because once you played a map once, you’d know the positions of things so interrogations didnt matter. I took out the alternative succubus because it made it less clear what enemies were what, and I also didn’t want to redraw all the succubus/incubus for different outfits<br/></p>

Hello! I love both RoR and Deadbolt a lot, Deadbolt more though. Being the tiniest reaper just feels good, and everything about it feels tight and well designed. Do you have any advice for aspiring pixel artists?
<p>Always bizarre to me when people ask me for pixel advice - I feel like my art is functional, not very pretty, but whatever!<br/><br/>I’d say the fastest way to learn is to really really study the pixel art you do like, and you’ll develop your style over time. Animation is an entirely different skillset, and you should probably practice either animating or drawing separately before attempting to do both.<br/></p>

Hi ! I hope you're doing good and that you had fun at PAX. I recently started developping games and am focusing on PGC. I have no problem generating Isaac-like dungeons/caves, but having a hard time understanding how you made all the platforms in RoR accessible. Can you recommend learning ressources or PGC techniques to look at ? In any case, thank you for making great games :)
<p>The terrain in RoR isn&rsquo;t procedurally generated - I think that there&rsquo;s a place for procedural generation, but I&rsquo;ve never been satisfied with terrain in other similar games, so they&rsquo;re hand crafted with a few permutations</p>

not sure if this is something you want to discuss, but i was wondering how deadbolt is doing regarding sales? I have a feeling that ror got a quite a lot of media attention in the end and I guess you made quite some profit from it. In my humble opinion deadbolt is a superior game, showing clear signs of your growth in design and art, and i really hope and wish it gets the attention it deserves as well as the financial success (even if small) that you are hoping for! all the best
<p>RoR got way more media attention than DEADBOLT, for sure. I personally am more proud of DEADBOLT, but they are both completely different games (and more importantly, were made with two different intents!)<br/><br/>Risk of Rain was made with an audience in mind (roguelike players), which is much better from a business perspective.<br/><br/>DEADBOLT was made with an experience in mind (feelin badass), which is better from an&hellip; artistic perspective? Maybe? But no amount of marketing can create an audience that doesn’t exist.<br/></p>

<p>The nice thing about doing both the art and code is that when I get frustrated or burnt out with one, I can work on the other. USUALLY I’d do the art first, because I need inspiration of how cool its gonna look before I can get motivated to code it<br/></p>

<p>Generally speaking:<br/><br/>Lights go to yellow and less saturation<br/>Darks go to either purple/blue and more saturation<br/><br/>That’s a general rule, but sometimes you can get some really cool looks if you push to other colours (dark reds, light greens will make a very sickley palette, pushing to warmer will make it feel cozier, etc) or just kinda randomly push to random colours throughout the palette. I also tend to have pretty low saturation, but that’s just my style!<br/></p>

How are you producing those neat 3D pixel-art-esque models? Are you animating it all, or using a 3D tools and rendering at low resolution?
<p>These are all done in blender, and then upscaled 2x with no AA/interpolation (point filtering)! There’s no way I could animate this well by hand :&gt;<br/></p>

<p>Probably Ifrit? Not really happy with how that turned out, it really could use a lot more polish but I wasn’t comfortable making such an enormous sprite at the time<br/></p>

Hey i'm currently in college and i'ts my dream to be a game developer, and I'm currently prototyping something, but my question is whether you have any tips on pursuing game development?
<p>I’d say that in general:</p><p>-Use a prebuilt engine, specifically Unity and GameMaker are good choices but anything you can be productive in</p><p>-It’s easier to learn if you can do sprites, coding, and sound effects yourself. You’ll become a generally very well-rounded dev that way, since so many of those are interconnected to make a good game<br/></p><p>-Kickstarter is good for publicity</p><p>-Publishers can also be good if you’re new - the indie publishers are usually very unintrusive<br/><br/>-Just practice a bunch!<br/></p>

hey hopoo, third round playing the campaign of deadbolt. absolutely my favourite game of the year so far. playing around and trying the different weapons. quick question, what are some of the inspirations for the guns. especially for the revenant. love it, but which real gun did you take as template for it? thanks!
<p>The Revenant was inspired by really over-the-top high powered revolvers like the Taurus Raging Bull! The other weapons are pretty clear in their inspirations, with the old-world rifle being an AK47 etc. The game is kinda generally based around tropes.<br/></p>

Hey, sorry if this has been asked before, but what are your plans with aiming? From the video, it looks like there's aimlock, but would there be an option to toggle that off or something similar?
<p>The aimlock is a special ability the Huntress has, along with being able to fire while sprinting - with the drawback that she has much shorter range than most other ranged characters<br/></p>

Reblog name: 
Any chance chests will be opened clientside? For example: player 1 opens a chest and gets something, but it doesn’t open for anyone else, so players 2, 3, and 4 can open the same chest and get themselves items. This could easily fix the issue of playing with more people making it too hard to progress since nobody is getting enough items. Clientside chests might need to come with a reduction to chests in a level overall for balance reasons, but it’d help 4p squads not suffer for playing with 4p
<p>That would totally fix that issue, but would go against one of my own personal design rules when making online games.<br/><br/>I personally think that a lot of multiplayer games nowadays reaaally suffer from “instancing” or local events. I think that a lot of the fun of multiplayer online games is experiencing stuff together in the same world, and instancing segments the game into a&hellip; semi-shared world. You’re not playing the same game, its like you all hit Start at the same time on a single player match. I want to avoid any local instancing as much as possible so you can share moments like when a friend gets a very rare item drop.<br/></p>

Will the number of enemies and onscreen projectiles be as good as the original? I want to feel the pain and suffering of watching like ten elite enemies spawn the moment teleporter activates, and immediately hear an Overloading Magma Worm coming to fuck my shit up - but in 3D and with better performance. From what you showed of the video and gif this latest update, you are 8 minutes in and with only 8 enemies and no onscreen bullets. That's not Monsoon difficulty is it?
<p>That is definitely the intent!  We’re planning on doing a pass on the director and overall balance very soon. It’s a nice feeling that that’s something we can now focus on, because it means development is going well enough that we can start thinking about game balance. Enemies also have a much bigger sphere of influence in RoR2 - most enemies were melee range in RoR1, with affixes and spiders being the biggest source of projectiles. In contrast, most enemies in RoR2 currently have projectiles. We also have to make sure that every projectile can’t be dodged by circle strafing. <br/></p><p>We always appreciate this sort of feedback, by the way. We’re pretty deep in RoR2 so maybe something obvious to an outside viewer totally slips our mind, so reminders are nice :)<br/></p>

Hey guys, big fan of Risk of Rain with easily a few hundred hours logged. Followed since the first devblog and I'm deeply impressed with the progress/excited for this game. I agree with the previous comment asking for support classes, and am wondering if any local co op will exist (In the form of two player splitscreen or something of the sort)? I'm aware of the limitations with screen space, but local multiplayer is a dying scene and a market easily tapped imo. Thanks for all the hard work!
<p>Yep, we currently have split screen working, the only hurdle I can think of atm is performance if we ever port to a console later down the line. <br/><br/>As for support classes&hellip; we really don’t want playing RoR2 in single player to be a shadow of playing it in multiplayer, if that makes sense. We have some items that have area of effect buffs (like the Warbanner) that help better in cooperative scenarios. A new effect we’re also testing on the Engineer to replace his harpoons is a shield that you can transfer to a nearby ally - since you always have an ally in single player (your turret), it doesn’t feel bad to see that ability<br/></p>

My favorite part of RoR was playing it on the PsVita on the go, in my opinion it was the best platform to play it on. RoR2 looks amazing and I'd be willing to purchase it on any platform it comes out in but I would really prefer it on the Vita. My main concern is that the move from 2-D to 3-D may come with the trade off of it not being on the Vita due to a size or running problem. Do you think the game would run fine on the handheld and are you planning to release the game on it?
<p>Sadly I think there’s no way :( getting RoR1 to run on the Vita was already a challenge in itself<br/></p>

I noticed from your screenshots that there is no longer a meter that shows how difficult the game has gotten (Normal, hard, insane, I CAN SEE YOU, ect.) Will it be making a comeback in RoR2? It was nice to be able to gauge how much time we had before the game got harder, and the names were very creative!
<p>Nope, HUD is just a work in progress and we haven’t gotten to the timer yet. I think it could’ve been a bit more clear to draw the connection between time = difficulty so we’ll have to think of how to make that more obvious<br/></p>

Hi, guys!  Is there anything you guys can say about how the level design process has changed from 2D to 3D?  Less verticality?  More?  Are the levels pretty open or more segmented?  I am very, very excited.
<p>Level design is definitely our weakest spot at the moment in development - we want to make sure we don’t make a flat map with little rocks spread about. The most difficult thing for us (I think?) is that doing concept art for 3D spaces on 2D paper isn’t very useful, so we end up diving directly into the editor. We also don’t have climbing ropes in RoR2, so we’re missing a vertical element we used to have. Thoughts?<br/></p>

This probably a bit late, but in DEADBOLT, why do the undead resist getting killed by Reapers? Isn't it a first class ticket to the afterlife, and presumably warmth?
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-DEDBORT SPOILERS&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/></p><p>Yes! The entirety of the Place’s theme is that of irony - which is hellish in its own way.<br/><br/>The obvious ones are the undead themselves - zombies are from drug overdoses, yet they are obsessed with ash. Vampires were betrayed by a lover in their previous life, yet are the most lustful and are always looking for new partners. Skeletons killed themselves, yet seek the warmth (life) that they used to have. There are also smaller interactions as well that highlight that irony. Timur can only be killed by his own traps, and Madam Stela is doing all of this so she can see the sun again, which would (if she behaves like a classic vampire) lead to her death. Skeletons are the only ones who can be revived, yet they’re the ones that wanted to be dead in the first place.<br/><br/>Most important of all is the story of Ibzan and the fireplace - despite being the god of life, the fireplace failed to give Ibzan something to live <i>for, </i>resulting in his suicide and the catalyst for all the events in DEADBOLT. This is also why the fireplace showers you with awkward gifts - he doesn’t actually know what makes life worth living, but he’s trying his best to not lose you as well.<br/></p>

Hello Hopoo. Big fan of RoR1, almost sunk 100 hrs in it (without even completing it to 100%... but that's another story). I ain't about to tell you how to do your work, but please accept this word of advice: please don't let the hype get to your head and rush to the release date. Take all the time you need to finish, flesh out, polish and rinse your game, and don't rush release. Too many potentially great games have suffered horribly from rushed release. Keep up the good work, and best of luck.
<p>Thank you very much - I appreciate the reminder. We will do our best to keep our head in the game :&gt;<br/></p>

One of the things that was appealing to people in RoR was the pixel art style. Do you expect that to have an impact with sales in the second game?
<p>From a business standpoint, it’d probably be best if we stuck to pixel art forever - it’s easy and looks good. But gamedev has always been a hobby, and we just want to <i>try</i> 3D because of the potential it has, and we think we could make a fun game.<br/><br/>3D has a couple big pro and cons from 2D, but the biggest factor is that graphics is extremely technical in 3D - it requires a lot of shader and lighting work. This is also a blessing in disguise, because you can improve the entire look of your game in an hour after shader tweaks or post processes.<br/></p>

The implementation of the 57 leaf clover sounds cool in theory, but with four players and hundreds of entities and several re-rolls on every single RNG event.... Wouldn't that cause an ENORMOUS drain on processing power? Like, O(2^n) at least?
<p style="">

We haven&rsquo;t found any particular reason for concern. In tests where we&rsquo;ve stacked 30+ clovers there wasn&rsquo;t any performance hit we could notice. The checks also stop rolling once there&rsquo;s success, and you probably won&rsquo;t get so many unless you&rsquo;re playing on Command where stuff is gonna get kinda goofy to begin with. We&rsquo;re also currently using Unity&rsquo;s built-in RNG, but because we will want multiple RNG instances and serializable RNG states we&rsquo;re looking to replace it; we haven&rsquo;t done much looking yet but xoroshiro128plus is a very appealing option which we&rsquo;re hoping will yield good performance benefits. <br/><br/>-ghor

<p>Hmm&hellip; maybe? I definitely don’t want a bunch of numerics like +5% chance to fire a missile and +150% more damage every time you pick up a weapon, but it MIGHT be interesting to go<br/><br/>Chance to fire a missile on hit (first stack)<br/>Increase your chance to fire a missile (later stacks)<br/><br/>When you pick up the item?

The thing we’ve been really focusing on is polish - so we can show off our game more.<br/><br/>The awkward thing with game development is that it’s ALWAYS in development - models that used to be good are now bad in light of honed skills or change in art direction. Placeholder stuff isn’t always cubes and capsules - sometimes its just old models or rough drafts. <b>But to an observer, old (now placeholder) assets and bad assets are one and the same.</b></p><p>When we show off a long gameplay clip (which we will!), I want it to be a proper representation of the overall quality we’re hoping to hit with the final release so we can reaaaally get good feedback. If we showed a 30 minute clip right now, I feel like we’d be saying “Oh, but thats placeholder” or “oh thats an old thing” or “yeah thats not done yet” to 99% of the feedback we get, which then sounds like we’re making a bunch of excuses, if that makes sense? This became a bit rambley but yeah<br/></p>

Normally I would never suggest this, knowing how you started out in /agdg/, but you really gotta advertise/shill this in more places. Feels like not many people outside of Twitter and the /v/ threads know this is in the works, and it would be nice for you guys to get more people in the know. Just saying.
<p>Thanks for the advice! In all honesty, we simply don’t have the energy or the manpower to do a long-term advertisement cycle - we have no idea how long the development of the game takes, but we also don’t want to seem like we’re doing nothing. The devblog was our nice middle ground for people who wanted to see what we were up to without putting in a bunch of effort to advertise. Presumably as we come closer to launch we will take marketing more seriously (no idea how yet) - we were definitely too lax with it when it came to DEADBOLT.<br/></p>

Hey Hopoo Team, big fan of the first RoR and DEADBOLT, found out about this DevBlog by chance and naturally binged through all the Updates. I am super excited. As I looked at all the little sneak peeks I was wondering about the cameraposition of the player. As seen in most Screenshots, the perspective is 'Above-the-Head', will it be possible to change that to a more 'Over-The-Shoulder' kind of view as an option?
<p>Hi!<br/><br/>Been gettin’ that a lot - on a technical level, the camera position is simply a vector3 and can be easily adjusted.<br/><br/>On a <i>design </i>standpoint, a game’s entire gameplay is really based around its camera position. We’ve gotten a lot of requests for over-the-shoulder.<br/><br/>Our logic for doing directly behind is:<br/>-The camera has to be zoomed out enough to see your feet for platforming sections. Most 3D platformers have their camera centered or in fixed position to help aid jumps</p><p>-Risk of Rain has a lot of spherical/orbital auras around your player. It’s important you can see the edge of the sphere, and if it’s offset, it can be disorienting and also the radius has to be smaller equal to the offset so it still remains in the camera frame<br/><br/>-You get swarmed a lot, and a bias to one side can make certain directions of attack deadlier than others</p><p>-
Obscuring the attack path from the player to the cursor is usually not too big of an issue because of the scale of the enemies. </p><p><br/>However&hellip; this is obviously our first 3D game, so our logic could to be totally wrong. Tell us if this makes sense - we try over the shoulder semi frequently, but the things above always cause us issues. <br/></p>

The one and only thing I was missing in the original RoR were support classes. Now there were a few items, including the chunk of meat and the interstellar desk plant, capable of spawning healing drops for you as well as your teammates, but that's about it. Now my question is: Will there be support-capable playable characters and items in RoR2? (Also, will drones make a return?)
<p>We actually do have a few more aura items this time around (examples in the original being Warbanner and Mushroom) - the current implementation of the Engineer actually has a shield that can be passed around to allies. I think aura items are a nice midway so the game can still be enjoyed in single player but can be enhanced in multiplayer<br/></p>

Hey guys! Super excited for RoR2! But, I have know, is CHEF coming back?
<p>Gettin a lot of questions about classes! Ultimately we won’t know until much further into development, but as an outline:<br/><br/><b>Currently being developed / was developed but paused:<br/></b>Commando<br/>Engi<br/>Bandit<br/>HAN-D<br/>Huntress</p><p>If it’s not on that list we haven’t started done any implementation yet. We want to make sure it feels like a new game and not just RoR1 in 3D, so we will definitely have to let some characters go. Some would have new design windows opened up in 3D imo (Sniper, Loader?) and I can see some having struggles<br/></p>

What is your plan with certain artifacts combos from the original game? Combining Glass and Command combined with Infusion was an incredibly overpowered combination, and I was wondering if that awesome setup would be making a return. On another note, what about the origin and stopwatch exploit that allowed a truly massive vanguard of imps to swarm in? Will that be making a return in some shape or form, possibly as a feature this time?
<p>Glass and Command I would say were the two most successful artifacts, so they’re likely coming back (compared to something like say distortion, which made the game difficult but it wasn’t particularly fun. Spite is fun)<br/><br/>As for the bug&hellip; not sure whether or not origin is returning. However it was cool that people could keep the portal open as long as they thought they could handle. <br/></p>

So, Risk of Rain's lore (I don't know if you can really call it a story) was very backseat. You had to do a lot of digging in order to uncover a lot of it, and especially a lot was left to speculation. Additionally, at the very end, Providence's monster log left with a bit of a cliffhanger. Will this be expanded upon in Risk of Rain 2? And additionally, will ROR2 have a bit more concrete lore or will it be roughly the same, as in "there's lore to uncover, but it's not super huge".
<p>We’re aiming for the story of the individual still to take a back seat (and for a majority of the world-building to take place outside of the run), but we’re hoping to explore the lore of the planet, Providence, and the different races there<br/></p>

<p>I think the cover art is the most realistic depiction - I reckon that his hands/legs are covered by gloves and pants, they aren’t naturally black like that. Probably black shoes but like noone in the game has shoes soo<br/><br/>Also yeah, it’s a lighter - it has some association with the fireplace, and Ibzan’s no longer works &lt;/3 At one point in development he’d flick the lighter on to talk to the fireplace remotely, but that was scrapped pretty early.<br/></p>

Hey, I'm really looking forward to Deadbolt, it looks amazing! My question is if it will get ports to OSX and Linux as Risk of Rain did?
<p>Since I actually don’t /own/ any OSX or Linux machines I cant get enough testing to be comfortable releasing those on launch. I learned alot from RoR and #1 is to play test play test play test for bugs. If there’s a huge demand for it I’d hope to get around to an OSX and Linux though!<br/></p>

What's your favorite indie games or inspirations in general?
<p>Favorite indie game I’d have to say is iji - it was a really good game, I loved the artstyle and the multiple playthrough aspects where you could rank up new things and do pacifist runs etc. It really motivated me to get into game dev as well.<br/><br/>As for inspirations, it’s generally more art-oriented (i’m a big sucker for people with really good pixel art animations/low poly/character design)<br/></p>

You and Chris Christodoulou are such an amazing team. I cannot separate the genius of Risk of Rain's gameplay from the genius of its music, or vice versa. When do we get to hear the sick beats he's preparing for Deadbolt? 
<p>Hey, thanks! Hopefully soon - I’m sure he’ll release an album at the same time we launch (and I’m aiming for end of march-ish)<br/></p>

Hi, I've just read about your game Deadbolt at kotaku and went to download the demo to try it because of what i saw it looked really awesome. Much to my surprise you took it down. Dude i really would love to try your game if that doesn't bother you. Greetings from Venezuela!
<p>Hey hey! I took the alpha build down because it was A. very unpolished (~8 months ago was when I posted it), and B. it had some big gameplay flaws (absolutely helpless when out of ammo, pistol sucked in general, enemy AI was wonky etc). You’re gonna have to trust me when I say its for the better! Once all the gameplay stuff is super solid and down I’ll release a demo that’s better representative of how the game plays, how it’s gonna run on your machine/resolution, etc. Like a real demo.<br/></p>

IF I WAS TO ADD MORE STUFF, I’D HAVE TO REMAKE THE ENTIRE GAME FROM SCRATCH. HOWEVER, I HEAR LOUD AND CLEAR THAT PEOPLE WANT MORE RISK OF RAIN.

Hey i'm a big fan of your games especially Risk of Rain! I was wondering if you would consider doing something like an open development much like what nuclear throne is doing now, for your future games? It would allow the community to watch and put their own ideas, it would also help some people that are learning gamemaker and pixel art. Please consider it if you can. 
<p>I had a closed beta for RoR and I think it worked great. I&rsquo;m afraid of large Early Access for my game because 1.) I think it kinda spoils the game for a lot of people in its state, 2.) It&rsquo;s so easy to be caught up in community management over development, and 3.) it&rsquo;s SO easy to stop working once you&rsquo;re on it. Motivation is the hardest part of game dev and I&rsquo;d be highly hesitant. I really enjoyed the community feedback of a small beta though.</p>

<p>It’d require a bit of change in gameplay I think because its hard to have the accuracy and speed needed to change targets and do headshots on consoles. Maybe RMB would “lock on” to the nearest target and you can flick the stick up/down to aim, like GTA 4<br/></p>

Hey! How are you? Hope you're having a nice day. I don't know if you've answered this or not (I just found you after admiring your lovely pixel characters for way too long) but what do you use to animate? I've always wanted to dabble in it but didn't know where to start.
<p>I use MS Paint for pixeling, and GraphicsGale for animation! It really doesn’t matter what tool as long as you’re comfortable with its hotkeys; my workflow spans like, 3 programs but it feels very natural to me<br/></p>

I know that RoR is done content-wise, but what would you change in the game overall? 
<p>A big thing is making the online smoother without the port forwarding stuff. Dunno how that’d be done.<br/><br/>A more game design thing is that I would want each run to be a bit more unique; a goal would be being able to see a screenshot and say “hey yeah, that was my run.” Don’t know how that would be possible, but right now most runs eventually end up lookin’ the same.<br/></p>

Hey Hopoo! I really like the way you apply bloodstains to the background. Are you using a Vertex Shader + Fragments, or are you applying a mask? Illuminate me, please :D 
<p>It’s a “surface” (so yeah, a mask.) The reason it performs so well with a million bloodstains is that it just draws on top of the surface without ever wiping it, so it just draws 1 surface regardless of the number of blood splatters. I use the same technique for bullet oles in doors. This does add a unique challenge to the animation of it though, since the last frame will look like every frame super-imposed on top of each other, so theres a limit in what I can animate.<br/><br/><br/></p>

Risk of Rain, is one of the best Roguelikes there is, 10/10 on steam and almost all of the negative reviews are due to bugs/crashes you fixed this week, it's had multiple games such as Warlocks and Dungeon Souls heavily influenced by it, it's an amazing piece of work and one of my favorite games, I hope, sincerely that after deadbolt you create a sequel, or a prequel, or an unrelated game with the same mechanics/features. Please, please do not waste such an opportunity, thank you. ~ A Fan
<p>Thanks so much for the words! There’s definitely still a lot of potential in Risk of Rain still, and a lot I would redo if I had the chance.<br/></p>

It just isn&rsquo;t very fun; I think a necromancer game can be pretty tough to make fun in actuality, rather than concept (like PRESSURE)<br/><br/>However, it does have some kind of spark that a lot of people like from what is essentially just webms of me shooting defenseless people, and thats important too.</p>

Hi, your May/07 post seem to suggest that Risk of Rain's GM8.1 to GM:S port has not started, coupled together with the lack of any updates recently (maybe I've missed some?) it is very  disheartening. I know some of you have college and other stuff but may I ask, what's been worked on currently in terms of Risk of Rain? I ask this as a huge fan of the game but has been unable to play the game completely since the last update due to bugs and other issues. Cheers, Ben
<p>We actually found someone to port it to GM:S, and it started ~2 days ago. We just have to wait for that to finish before we can work on the game. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll have two versions of the game: one with new features and fixes, and one with cross-platform support</p>

<p>What have you got in mind for the gameplay? Currently, hardest part of design for the game is making sure it isn&rsquo;t too micro-y but still allowing for in-depth combat.<br/><br/>D2 Necro, which was a big inspiration, was very non-interactive (usually). Any examples of games with good minion-master gameplay?</p>

What's happening with Mac Risk of Rain? :(
<p>So, the big next step for RoR is porting from GM 8.1 (the current one) to GM:Studio, which allows for exporting to:</p>
<ul><li>Mac</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>Sony Platforms (PS4 + Vita)</li>
</ul><p>It should <em>also</em> have a considerable performance boost for PC, which is really needed. This isn&rsquo;t a very easy task (mostly because the online will have to be recoded entirely), so it&rsquo;ll take a while, but it <em>will</em> be happening. This also means that we have one consistent code base to work off of, rather than a bunch of different ones.</p>

How does the spawning of monsterd in Risk of Rain work? How does it determine to spawn an elite, blighted, or boss? And which enemy? I've heard of this hidden 'dictator' that runs it all in the program, just a tad confused as to how that all works.
<p>Long story short, each stage has about ~6 monster &ldquo;cards&rdquo; that the AI can randomly choose from. Every time the director (AI) wants to spawn something, it<br/><br/>1. Picks a random card out of 6</p>
<p>2. Sees if it can afford its cost (each card is assigned a cost, and the director gains 1 point a second. A lemurian may cost 6 points, while a Magma Worm will cost 800. The rate the director gains points goes up, so it becomes 2 a second, 3 a second, etc)</p>
<p>3. If it can, it checks if it can afford 10x the card cost. If it can, it spawns it as a blighted elite monster, otherwise&hellip;</p>
<p>4. It checks if it can afford 4x the card cost. If it can, it spawns it as an elite monster, otherwise it spawns normally.</p>
<p>5. The director then checks if it can spawn the same monster again, and if it can, will wait ~&frac14; a second to play the same card, up to 4? times.</p>
<p>6. Once it runs out of points, it waits between 15 seconds and 1 minute to pull another card and repeats the process.</p>

<p>Well… do it anyways!<br/><br/>1. You’ll already have an established fanbase to appeal to (especially if they really want more content/want a “sequel”)<br/><br/>2. If you’re stuck, game design-wise, you can always see what they did.</p>
<p>3. Chances are, the games actually aren’t <em>that</em> similar anyways. Things like art style similarities will usually draw more parallels to other games than gameplay similarities will.</p>

Its easier if you&rsquo;re more of a one-man army, so you can see how the sound plays with the art plays with the gameplay.<br/><br/><br/>Use whatever tools you&rsquo;re comfortable with (GameMaker and MS Paint/GraphicsGale personally for me), and just try out a protoype of the basics (movement and easy combat). If it feels good, chances are, its good. If it feels bad, well, at least you tried!</p>

Hey Hopoo, I know you said on /v/ that the necromancer game wasn't really an actual project, but I think I speak for a lot of anons when I say PLEASE GOD MAKE IT PLEASE
<p>Hey, thanks for all the sudden interest! What would you want in a necromancer game?<br/><br/>Main concern is how to make mob combat interesting in a 2D perspective.</p>

RoR is a fun time.  It has the ability to instill competition within the player.  I find myself playing just a few games at a time trying to be smarter or trying a different strategy than my previous run.  Side note, I was curious if you or anyone on Starbound's team had come to you about maybe creating iterations of some of the RoR character armors or weapons in game?  I think the mash up would be really neat.  I'm also digging your necro posts and cant wait to see what comes from it.
<p>Naw, we haven&rsquo;t talked about cameos or anything, but that <em>would</em> be neat, I agree!</p>

What would you... er, recommend for someone who wants to get into the game development industry, who wants to develop games for a career? Go to college and study specific courses? Or just teach yourself? How do you also manage your job, as you don't have a constant flow of money and at times it may be tough. Would it be better working for a somewhat larger company (not necessarily a AAA one), or with minimal people? (2-3 etc).
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say. Most indie developers usually have backgrounds in larger companies. I always recommend GameMaker for new developers. College courses are useful for learning programming, which is absolutely essential; whether or not &ldquo;game design&rdquo; classes are useful to you would be a question to have for your advisor. <br/><br/>I had a part-time job at Pagliaccis while working on Risk of Rain; you&rsquo;ll find that working on games don&rsquo;t feel like a job, but more like a hobby. Don&rsquo;t worry about time; you&rsquo;ll find it.<br/><br/>Now, me personally? I self-taught from a fairly young age, and got super lucky in being successful independently. Whether or not that is a path to follow is up to you, but it is not a very <em>consistent</em> one.</p>

how do you go about starting new games? i really want to try making games, and you seem do it so effortlessly, like how you just got an idea for that necromancy game and then suddenly have gifs of the development
<p>I usually start with mockups to draw inspiration; if it looks cool, chances are it has potential to <em>be </em>cool.</p>
<p>I use GameMaker:Studio because it is, by far, the <em>fastest</em> way to prototype and complete a 2D game. However, you <em>will </em>be sacrificing performance (although that is a very small problem in GM:S, it was a big one in GM 8.1, as seen in Risk of Rain)</p>

<p>I personally don&rsquo;t use tablets to draw pixel art, because precise control is pretty important. As for programs, I use Microsoft Paint (Vista version, not any later) for general drawing/doodling, and Graphics Gale for animating. If you&rsquo;re just starting out, get into the habit of just using Graphics Gale and skip paint because it sucks to change workflows~</p>

<p>Thats a bug in the old version of the alpha, where the game doesn&rsquo;t save and the gamepad turns on by itself.<br/><br/>You can either a.)Download the demo, which fixes this problem, or if you want to play with all the goodies in the alpha b.)Turn off gamepad in the options!</p>

Hey Hopoo, I played the Deadbolt demo and it was pretty good. I was hoping to ask is when you guys are finished with Deadbolt, will you go back to Risk of Rain to add more features? It has a lot of potential for a game to be abandoned and I absolutely love the game.
<p>It does have a lot of potential, but it’s codebase is a total spaghetti monster from my 19 year old self. If I was to go back to Risk of Rain, I’d definitely recode the whole thing. I’d consider Risk of Rain in its current state to be feature complete, though, so if there was more stuff to add&hellip; it’d be a sequel? Obviously not promising anything :&gt;<br/></p>

It’s cool the triangle set up being how it is, but playing 10 missions of apartments and houses in a row -&gt; 10 missions of clubs in a row -&gt; etc seems a bit repetitive. I’d like to mix and match them, but can’t really do that if you have to complete 1 gang before another and want to have each gang be more difficult than the previous. Thoughts?<br/></p>

Are you worried about the depth of your game? i'm just curious to know what the replay value or the different ways to take on a level will be. 
<p>I’m trying a different design philosophy; I think a lot of games recently focus so much on replay value that you end up replaying a boring game a bunch of times, rather than play a good game once through.<br/><br/>The stages SHOULD have different ways to complete, and that’s something I’ll try to facilitate through more complex level designs, but its not for the intent of replayability. I will ship with a level editor though, so if you’re interested in the game then you could join a community and try user stages (or that’s the hope anyways.)<br/></p>

<p>Yes, send an email to spacegame2012@gmail.com.

I really enjoyed playing this! You've got a great little idea here and I really think it's gonna take off. Can't wait until the final release. The only suggestion I have is possibly finding some background music. The game feels just a little empty without anything. Maybe something that a little jazz/rock?
<p>The idea i’ve been throwing around in my head is that each faction would have their own corresponding music associated with them (zombies = hip hop, vampires = house, you = jazz etc) but nothing has really started yet in the music front. I think music can really make (or break) a game, so I’d like to take a closer look in integrating it with the gameplay this time around.<br/></p>

Hey! Really dig your fireplace particle effect, tried to recreate it in HTML Canvas to understand it better.  I'm using a horizontal line emitter that moves left & right semi-randomly, and constant velocity particles.  Couple of things I couldn't figure out: what the sprites should look like, particle rotation (?), and how to get the turbulent appearance (particles in mine look very predictable).  Would you mind taking a look? Can't post a link here, but it's newest repo on my GitHub, same name
<p>1. I use a spring-mass-damper to move the line emitter back and forth, makes it look a little smoother<br/></p><p>2. The particles come out in a 0-180 degree direction, with a gravity force upwards so it rotates towards that eventually; maybe that&rsquo;s the turbulence you&rsquo;re talking about?<br/><br/>3. The particles rotate very slowly and come out at a random angle. They also shrink over time, rather than alpha fade away. I use 3 sets of particles at different depths + size + color to add volume<br/><br/>4. They choose from a random subimage on creation from list <br/></p><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/87ee07375cc8a4524f10c3f8b635e5bf/tumblr_inline_nkfxfsA8pL1rcwq50.png"/></figure><p>5. The particles have a chance of spawning a spark particle during its lifetime; the spark particle has a wide variance on direction, so it&rsquo;ll kinda jitter around. It also flickers on/off. Nice thing about this is that the number of sparks scale with the life of the flame particles, so I can scale the particle life up/down to adjust flame height for different situations</p><p>6. The base of the flame spawns a few flames randomly to make it look fatter and less like a candlelight<br/><br/>Hope that helps!<br/></p>

Sorry, your cries are being absolutely heard, and I&rsquo;ll get to it as soon as school lets me!</p>

This is the actual question, however. (( Please feel free to edit this one for reposting. My Chrome is weird and won't let me linebreak in Tumblr. )) Do you have plans on letting players make their own levels via mods and Workshop and stuff? The only game similar to this one is a Zombie-based game, and it has a level editor. Gotta compete, mang!
<p>Sadly (and this is requested a lot), that is something that can&rsquo;t really be integrated after a game is finished, especially in GM. However, it is something I am conscious of going forward; I didn&rsquo;t realize how big the modding community was!</p>

You know how much the community is anticipating the update? You've made something great and you should be proud. Where do you see yourself – in terms of game developing – in five years?

</blockquote>
<p><em>help help not the pressure I needed<br/><br/></em>I am proud, but I&rsquo;m also stressed all the time. I guess the expectations of like half a million people is a bit more than I expected. This ain&rsquo;t the beta where I bust out a build every week and then joke about how buggy it is with the community; I have a playerbase with expectations, and I hope I can meet them.<br/><br/>In terms of game development, I have no idea what I would be doing in 5 years; it is a long time, and I&rsquo;ve been only doing this for ~2 years, so your guess is as good as mine. At the moment I&rsquo;ve put my degree as a backup and plan on focusing on making more games post-graduation. <br/><br/>I want to make bigger games, but I simultaneously scare myself by thinking of a bigger game than RoR (in terms of development time, bugs, etc.) Not sure what that means for me. </p>

<p>Just draw tiny sprites until you can move onto making slightly-bigger sprites, it&rsquo;ll eventually look nice. Posting for feedback on any popular boards is good too.<br/><br/>Imo, a well-animated piece with crappy art looks a lot better than a well-drawn piece with crappy animation</p>

<p>None. No, really, I&rsquo;ve never taken anything game-related in university and neither has any other devs I&rsquo;ve known.<br/><br/>Just do it; people spend too much time wondering what the perfect way to do something is that they end up doing nothing in case it is inefficient. GM is easy for anyone to pick up.</p>

Is the golden gun ever going to stack properly?
<p>Does it feel underpowered? What stacking for the golden gun is reduce the amount of gold needed to hit the cap (from 700 to 350, etc).<br/><br/>At the moment that doesn&rsquo;t seem very rewarding, but once we change the cost of chests on later levels to be a little more costly it should balance out. The reason it doesn&rsquo;t raise the cap to 1400 (and the damage bonus with it) is because I felt that would be too snowball-y (more damage, more gold, more damage). Might be wrong though!</p>

this may have been asked previously or maybe i'm too dumb to read everything, but does the random generation apply to the levels themselves or are those planned to be static?
<p>Although nothing is ever really set in stone (hooray indie development with no concrete deadlines), its not planned at the moment.<br/><br/>Its one of the most requested features, but an entirely randomized map would be far down the line if ever implemented. Partially randomized could work, but I&rsquo;m not quite sure how to implement that while still having it be interesting.</p>

I encountered a bug in the game! I unlocked a bunch of items in normal diffculty, then when I went into casual mode all of my info in the Item Log disappeared which sucks. I understand you've made a choice about not putting things in the item log if you're in casual mode, but I presume deleting all my item log progress is not meant to happen :P
<p>Can&rsquo;t say I can recreate it. Did you extract the game? All the save files are in Save.ini, and it shouldn&rsquo;t be modified at all on casual. Did it ever come back? Did closing the game and opening it bring it back? <br/><br/>Thanks!</p>

<p>Sadly, I do not think our version of GameMaker supports either without a significant investment in our part. Once we do a KickStarter, however, it may be a possibility (assuming the game is playable on a mobile device, seeing as it requires some precise controls)</p>

<p>Yes, this is absolutely planned! This will be added the same time we add a character select screen, since you will be able to choose the option from there.</p>

<p>Yes, I am using GM7!<br/><br/>Whether a mac build really depends on yoyogames; because I don&rsquo;t own a mac, I dont exactly know how they work. I was under the impression that on a mac you could run a virtual machine to run exes; does that not work well for the game? <br/><br/>A mac build would be great to aim for!</p>

The magma worm seems to do no damage whatsoever. That's probably not intentional is it? Got to level three which is just level 2 again. Died to the Vagrant, but was close to killing it. Snakes killed it after I died. An abusable strat with toxic snakes and barbed wires is to activate the teleporter then wait on a rope in the second level. Probably not intentional, but easily kills enemies. Also guardian hearts make the life statues incredibly abusable. Regen shield, get item, repeat.
<p>Yup, the statue and shield interaction is fixed in the next update.<br/><br/>The magma worm doesn&rsquo;t deal touch damage; rather, when it hits any ground, it explodes. Does it still do no damage when youre on the ground?<br/><br/>I&rsquo;ve known about the thorns + worm being able to be abused by standing in certain spots, but I felt they really didn&rsquo;t do enough damage to be done efficiently. Not only that, but some of the flying enemies were added to combat exactly that. I&rsquo;ll keep watching, thank you!</p>

First time playing, first life, died instantly to a couple of wisp spawns as I was learning the controls, second one, I died after activating the teleporter, third time, I got to the second level and died after activating the teleporter. Game's pretty fun and looks neat. The missle launcher wrecked the boss jellyfish, but it couldn't save me from the constant swarm of lizardmen. Swarms of enemies seem like the most difficult part of this game. Also is it possible to unlock anything currently?
<p>Yes, the game does tend to throw you in the deep end. Item choice really makes a difference on how your playthrough is; had you found some of the items that give AoE on your attacks, but not single target damage, the boss may have been the hardest part.<br/><br/>At the moment, you can&rsquo;t unlock anything, simply because I need everyone to playtest as much content as possible.</p>

<p>The most helpful website for me was <a href="http://www.wayofthepixel.net/index.php?board=2.0">http://www.wayofthepixel.net/index.php?board=2.0</a>. I almost never posted (the board is pretty slow), but all the previous topics are extremely helpful in learning what the heck to do. I think this is the only site I visited about pixel art; just search whatever you want to know about, and there will probably be a topic about exactly what you want.</p>

why is the game so fucking hard? also do item effects actually stack?
<p>The game&rsquo;s balance stat is always being tested. As it is, the newest build is too hard and some of the scaling is being lowered, especially as time increases/you jump into the 2nd level.<br/><br/>And yes, all item effects stack. There are a few with diminishing returns (cooldown reduction, stun chance, etc) but most stack linearly.</p>

hey man, just wanted to ask a quick question about how you did some stuff in game maker. How'd you get the view to follow the player with out it messing up all your draw variables? 
<p>Not quite sure what you mean; do you mean having things follow the view? For example, the code for drawing the FPS is:<br/>draw_text_outline(&ldquo;FPS:&rdquo;+string(fps),view_xview+view_wview-6,view_yview+view_hview-6,c_dkgray,c_ltgray). This puts it in the bottom-right corner. Important thing is that view_xview and view_yview is the top-left corner of your view; essentially 0,0.</p>
